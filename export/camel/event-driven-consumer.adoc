Event Driven Consumer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/EventDrivenConsumer.html[Event
Driven Consumer] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns]. The default consumer model is event based (i.e. asynchronous)
as this means that the Camel container can then manage pooling,
threading and concurrency for you in a declarative manner.

The Event Driven Consumer is implemented by consumers implementing the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Processor.html[Processor]
interface which is invoked by the link:message-endpoint.html[Message
Endpoint] when a link:message.html[Message] is available for processing.

[[EventDrivenConsumer-Example]]
Example
+++++++

The following demonstrates
a http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Processor.html[Processor] defined
in the Camel  link:registry.html[Registry] which is invoked when an
event occurs from a link:jms.html[JMS] queue

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("jms:queue:foo")
    .processRef("processor");
----

 

**Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]**

[source,brush:,xml;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
    <from uri="jms:queue:foo"/>
    <to uri="processor"/>
</route>

[[EventDrivenConsumer-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
