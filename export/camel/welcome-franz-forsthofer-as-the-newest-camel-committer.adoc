A few weeks back the Camel PMC voted another one of the active and
talented contributors to become a committer.

 

Franz Forsthofer was actively involved with Apache Camel for a while. In
the past months his activity reached a new level. Franz contributed more
than 20 patches and he was acting as a committer. In recognition of his
work, the PMC only had to take care of the simple task of making that
official. Franz got his committer account already setup, concluding the
process of becoming the newest Camel rider.

 

On behalf of the Camel PMC, welcome aboard Franz and keep up the great
work!

Christian
