Is there an IDE for editing Camel routes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apache Camel offers no IDE out of the box.

You could use your Java IDE for smart completion when creating
link:routes.html[Java routing rules] via the link:dsl.html[DSL] which
will give you smart completion in Java code. +
Or you can use your XML IDE (with XSD smart completion) to edit the
link:spring.html[routing rules in XML] using the
link:xml-configuration.html[Xml Configuration]

Some of the link:commercial-camel-offerings.html[Commercial Companies]
offers IDE's and other tooling for Camel.
