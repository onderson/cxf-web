Parameter Binding Annotations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**camel-core**

The annotations below are all part of *camel-core* and thus does not
require *camel-spring* or link:spring.html[Spring]. These annotations
can be used with the link:bean.html[Bean] component or when invoking
beans in the link:dsl.html[DSL]

Annotations can be used to define an link:expression.html[Expression] or
to extract various headers, properties or payloads from a
link:message.html[Message] when invoking a bean method (see
link:bean-integration.html[Bean Integration] for more detail of how to
invoke bean methods) together with being useful to help disambiguate
which method to invoke.

If no annotations are used then Camel assumes that a single parameter is
the body of the message. Camel will then use the
link:type-converter.html[Type Converter] mechanism to convert from the
expression value to the actual type of the parameter.

The core annotations are as follows

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Annotation |Meaning |Parameter
|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Body.html[@Body]
|To bind to an inbound message body | 

|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/ExchangeException.html[@ExchangeException]
|To bind to an Exception set on the exchange | 

|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Header.html[@Header]
|To bind to an inbound message header |String name of the header

|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Headers.html[@Headers]
|To bind to the Map of the inbound message headers | 

|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/OutHeaders.html[@OutHeaders]
|To bind to the Map of the outbound message headers | 

|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Property.html[@Property]
|To bind to a named property on the exchange |String name of the
property

|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Properties.html[@Properties]
|To bind to the property map on the exchange | 

|http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Handler.html[@Handler]
|Not part as a type parameter but stated in this table anyway to spread
the good word that we have this annotation in Camel now. See more at
link:bean-binding.html[Bean Binding]. | 
|=======================================================================

The follow annotations `@Headers`, `@OutHeaders` and `@Properties` binds
to the backing `java.util.Map` so you can alter the content of these
maps directly, for instance using the `put` method to add a new entry.
See the OrderService class at link:exception-clause.html[Exception
Clause] for such an example. You can use `@Header("myHeader")` and
`@Property("myProperty")` to access the backing `java.util.Map`.

[[ParameterBindingAnnotations-Example]]
Example
^^^^^^^

In this example below we have a @Consume consumer (like message driven)
that consumes JMS messages from the activemq queue. We use the @Header
and @Body parameter binding annotations to bind from the JMSMessage to
the method parameters.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public class Foo {
    
    @Consume(uri = "activemq:my.queue")
    public void doSomething(@Header("JMSCorrelationID") String correlationID, @Body String body) {
        // process the inbound message here
    }

}
----

In the above Camel will extract the value of
Message.getJMSCorrelationID(), then using the
link:type-converter.html[Type Converter] to adapt the value to the type
of the parameter if required - it will inject the parameter value for
the *correlationID* parameter. Then the payload of the message will be
converted to a String and injected into the *body* parameter.

You don't necessarily need to use the @Consume annotation if you don't
want to as you could also make use of the Camel link:dsl.html[DSL] to
route to the bean's method as well.

[[ParameterBindingAnnotations-UsingtheDSLtoinvokethebeanmethod]]
Using the DSL to invoke the bean method
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here is another example which does not use link:pojo-consuming.html[POJO
Consuming] annotations but instead uses the link:dsl.html[DSL] to route
messages to the bean method

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public class Foo {
    public void doSomething(@Header("JMSCorrelationID") String correlationID, @Body String body) {
        // process the inbound message here
    }

}
----

The routing DSL then looks like this

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("activemq:someQueue").
  to("bean:myBean");
----

Here *myBean* would be looked up in the link:registry.html[Registry]
(such as JNDI or the Spring ApplicationContext), then the body of the
message would be used to try figure out what method to call.

If you want to be explicit you can use

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("activemq:someQueue").
  to("bean:myBean?methodName=doSomething");
----

And here we have a nifty example for you to show some great power in
Camel. You can mix and match the annotations with the normal parameters,
so we can have this example with annotations and the Exchange also:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void doSomething(@Header("user") String user, @Body String body, Exchange exchange) {
        exchange.getIn().setBody(body + "MyBean");
    }
----

[[ParameterBindingAnnotations-AnnotationBasedExpressionLanguage]]
Annotation Based Expression Language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also use any of the link:languages.html[Languages] supported in
Camel to bind expressions to method parameters when using
link:bean-integration.html[Bean Integration]. For example you can use
any of these annotations:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]

|=======================================================================

[[ParameterBindingAnnotations-Example:]]
Example:
++++++++

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public class Foo {
    
    @MessageDriven(uri = "activemq:my.queue")
    public void doSomething(@XPath("/foo/bar/text()") String correlationID, @Body String body) {
        // process the inbound message here
    }
}
----

[[ParameterBindingAnnotations-Advancedexampleusing@Bean]]
Advanced example using @Bean
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

And an example of using the the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/language/Bean.html[@Bean]
binding annotation, where you can use a link:pojo.html[POJO] where you
can do whatever java code you like:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public class Foo {
    
    @MessageDriven(uri = "activemq:my.queue")
    public void doSomething(@Bean("myCorrelationIdGenerator") String correlationID, @Body String body) {
        // process the inbound message here
    }
}
----

And then we can have a spring bean with the id
*myCorrelationIdGenerator* where we can compute the id.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public class MyIdGenerator {

    private UserManager userManager;

    public String generate(@Header(name = "user") String user, @Body String payload) throws Exception {
       User user = userManager.lookupUser(user);
       String userId = user.getPrimaryId();
       String id = userId + generateHashCodeForPayload(payload);
       return id;
   }
}
----

The link:pojo.html[POJO] MyIdGenerator has one public method that
accepts two parameters. However we have also annotated this one with the
@Header and @Body annotation to help Camel know what to bind here from
the Message from the Exchange being processed.

Of course this could be simplified a lot if you for instance just have a
simple id generator. But we wanted to demonstrate that you can use the
link:bean-binding.html[Bean Binding] annotations anywhere.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public class MySimpleIdGenerator {

    public static int generate()  {
       // generate a unique id
       return 123;
   }
}
----

And finally we just need to remember to have our bean registered in the
Spring link:registry.html[Registry]:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
   <bean id="myCorrelationIdGenerator" class="com.mycompany.MySimpleIdGenerator"/>
----

[[ParameterBindingAnnotations-Exampleusing]]
Example using link:groovy.html[Groovy]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this example we have an Exchange that has a User object stored in the
in header. This User object has methods to get some user information. We
want to use link:groovy.html[Groovy] to inject an expression that
extracts and concats the fullname of the user into the fullName
parameter.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void doSomething(@Groovy("$request.header['user'].firstName $request.header['user'].familyName) String fullName, @Body String body) {
        // process the inbound message here
    }
----

Groovy supports GStrings that is like a template where we can insert $
placeholders that will be evaluated by Groovy.
