Is it possible to start Camel as a standalone application, without
embedding it in another application?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes Camel can run standalone or in any container. Running Standalone is
as simple just to create a link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext], add
routes and start it. If you don't want to write your own java main, you
could use the one from link:spring.html[camel-spring]
(http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-spring/apidocs/) also used
by the link:camel-maven-plugin.html[Camel Maven Plugin].

The starting guide is a good place to start: +
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started]

And the concrete walk through a plain old java main example: +
link:walk-through-an-example.html[Walk through an Example]

The FAQ have some more details: +
link:faq.html[Faq]

And if you use Maven for your projects Camel has maven tools to boot up
in standalone mode and quickly run you Camel application: +
link:camel-maven-plugin.html[Camel Maven Plugin]

And check this link:cookbook.html[Cookbook] example:
link:running-camel-standalone-and-have-it-keep-running.html[Running
Camel standalone and have it keep running]

This is how you can run the link:examples.html[Examples] that is
included in the Camel distribution.
