*Available as of Camel 2.1*

**To be removed**

Unfortunately this feature did not work out, and is going to be replaced
with a new fully asynchronous routing engine in Camel 2.4. +
link:toasync.html[ToAsync] will be removed from *Camel 2.4* onwards. Do
not use this feature or prepare to migrate when upgrading to future
Camel releases!

[[ToAsync-Background]]
Background
^^^^^^^^^^

link:toasync.html[ToAsync] is a new feature build into the core of Camel
2.1. It sets the foundation base for non blocking asynchronous
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] messaging with Camel. By
*foundation* we mean that it has the moving pieces that makes Camel
link:components.html[Components] leverage this in case they natively
supports non blocking request reply. At this time of writing its only
the link:jetty.html[Jetty] component that offers this. Over time we will
incorporate this into other components. However don't despair as Camel
have fallback support for simulating asynchronous request/reply in the
Camel core, in cases where its not supported natively in the Camel
component used.

**May change in the future**

The current link:toasync.html[ToAsync] may change a bit in the future.
We may look into better ways for the caller to retrieve information
about the progress of the link:exchange.html[Exchange]. Currently the
caller will just _transfer_ the link:exchange.html[Exchange] to
link:toasync.html[ToAsync] and then continue.

[[ToAsync-Howdoesitwork?]]
How does it work?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel now has a new DSL named `toAsync` in the Java DSL. And in Spring
XML there is a new `async` boolean attribute on the `<to>` XML tag. So
in a Camel route you can leverage this by just using a using this when
sending to an endpoint when you do link:request-reply.html[Request
Reply] messaging.

The route below is from a unit test in Camel. Notice the new `toAsync`
where we use this in action. What happens is that the message is send
asynchronously to the `direct:bar` endpoint. When the reply comes back
the message is continued being routed on _the other side_ where its
routed to the `mock:result` endpoint. The number 5 indicates the thread
pool size, so we have 5 concurrent consumers to route the replies when
they come back.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    from("direct:start").to("mock:a").toAsync("direct:bar", 5).to("mock:result");

    from("direct:bar").to("mock:b").transform(constant("Bye World"));
----

This unit test is using the direct endpoint when sending using `toAsync`
and the direct component does *not* support non blocking request reply
messaging natively. And therefore Camel fallback to _simulate_ this by
transferring the Exchange to an internal thread pool which handles the
task of sending the Exchange. This then frees the burden of the original
thread to send the request and thus its work is offloaded and it can
continue. What it means is the that original thread is *not blocked*.
The internal thread pool will in the mean time send the request and
handover the exchange to the completed task queue when the reply comes
back, and then the Exchange can be continued routed in the route path.
In this example it will just route to the `mock:result` endpoint.

By using a component that truly supports non blocking
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] such as link:jetty.html[Jetty],
its in fact link:jetty.html[Jetty] itself that handles the
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] so the internal thread pool in
Camel is *not* used.

[[ToAsync-The]]
The link:http-async-example.html[HTTP Async Example]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this example we use the following route:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <route>
            <!-- we route from a direct endpoint -->
            <from uri="direct:start"/>
            <!-- log the request -->
            <to uri="log:+++ request +++"/>
            <!-- then doing a non blocking async request/reply to the http server with a pool of 10 threads -->
            <to uri="jetty://http://0.0.0.0:9123/myapp" async="true" poolSize="10"/>
            <!-- the reply from the server is logged -->
            <to uri="log:+++  reply  +++"/>
            <!-- and to our mock so we can assert we got all responses -->
            <to ref="result"/>
        </route>
----

Notice how we have specified `async="true"` and `poolSize="10"` in the
`<to>` tag to leverage this. +
To learn more see and try this example yourself.

[[ToAsync-HowthisworksinsideCamel]]
How this works inside Camel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel uses the `org.apache.camel.AsyncProcessor` which is responsible
for processing the non blocking message.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
void process(Exchange exchange, AsyncCallback callback) throws Exception;
----

The idea is that you invoke the callback when the reply is ready.

The `org.apache.camel.AsyncCallback` has the following method

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
void onTaskCompleted(Exchange exchange);
----

which is the method to invoke when the reply is ready.

All the other moving parts is build directly into the core of Camel. So
you do not have to worry about that. +
If you want to take a look its implemented in the
`org.apache.camel.processor.SendAsyncProcessor` class.

[[ToAsync-JettyHttpProducer]]
JettyHttpProducer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This class is currently the only implementation of this feature.

Basically you do implement the `AsyncProcessor` interface

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public class JettyHttpProducer extends DefaultProducer implements AsyncProcessor
----

And then invoke the callback when the reply is ready and populated on
the Exchange. +
See the class `JettyContentExchange` how this is implemented in
link:jetty.html[Jetty].

[[ToAsync-WhatifaComponentdoesnotsupportnonblocking?]]
What if a Component does not support non blocking?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many components does not naturally support non blocking
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply]. The ones that does need to be
improved in Camel to support the `AsyncProcessor` to integrate with
link:toasync.html[ToAsync]. If a component *does not* support 'non
blocking' (i.e. does not use `AsyncProcessor` then Camel will automatic
fallback and simulate this by using an internal thread pool that sends
the request and blocks until the reply is ready. Just as it did in the
very first example on this page using the direct endpoint.

[[ToAsync-Configuringthreadpooling]]
Configuring thread pooling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You configure the thread pool on the `toAsync` by either supply a pool
size as the 2nd parameter as we saw in the first example. +
But you can also refer to a `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` as
follows:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("direct:start").to("mock:a").toAsync("direct:bar").executorServiceRef("mySharedPool").to("mock:result");
----

In the Spring XML there is an attribute to refer to the thread pool

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <to uri="jetty://http://0.0.0.0:9123/myapp" async="true" executorServiceRef="mySharedPool"/>
----
