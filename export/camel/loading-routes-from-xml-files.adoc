Loading routes from XML files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.6*

This cookbook shows how to load and add routes from XML files into an
existing link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext].

When adding routes as shown on this page, the routes is isolated and
cannot re-use any existing `onException`, `intercept` etc.

You can define Camel routes in XML files using the `<routes>` tag with
the namespace `"http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring"`. +
Suppose we have the bar route as shown below in the `barRoute.xml` XML
file.

*barRoute.xml*

We can then load this route and add to the existing
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] using the following lines of code:

*Java code*

If you are using older versions of Camel, you can do this as well but it
requires a bit more work. See this
