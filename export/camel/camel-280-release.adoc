[[Camel2.8.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.8.0 release which approx 422 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Fixed the OGNL support of link:simple.html[Simple] language to support
dots in key for map access.
* Improved OGNL support of link:simple.html[Simple] to support chained
[] indexes in List/Map so you can do: `body[0][cool]`, to acces a
`List<Map>` type.
* You can now configure the `resultType` when using
link:simple.html[Simple] expressions.
* You can now specify link:bean-binding.html[type parameters] in
link:bean.html[Bean] to exact select method to be used when having
overloaded methods (overloaded methods have same name, but vary in
parameter types).
* The link:ftp.html[SFTP] component now allows you to customize keep
alive settings.
* Fixed issue if explict setting `JmsMessage` body to `null` would cause
Camel to re-initialize the body from the underlying `javax.jms.Message`
on access again.
* link:mock.html[Mock] endpoints is now lenient, which means its easier
to replace components with link:mock.html[Mock] for testing purposes.
Using uri parameters which the link:mock.html[Mock] endpoint wont no
longer complain about being unknown parameters.
* Camel places a breadcrumb header in the Camel
link:message.html[Message] which allow us to keep track of messages
across transports such as link:jms.html[JMS], link:http.html[HTTP] and
many others. See more details at link:mdc-logging.html[MDC logging].
* Improved link:xpath.html[XPath] to allow GC to kick-in a bit earlier
to free memory as Camel will clear references to used
link:exchange.html[Exchange]s used during link:xpath.html[XPath]
evaluations.
* Fixed an issue using link:ftp.html[FTP] endpoints with the
link:intercept.html[interceptSendToEndpoint]
* link:using-camelproxy.html[Camel Proxy] supports asynchronous
invocations using `Future` handles.
* The
link:how-do-i-configure-the-maximum-endpoint-cache-size-for-camelcontext.html[endpoint
cache] can be configured on link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext].
* link:cometd.html[Cometd] supports custom security policy and
extensions as
http://cometd.org/documentation/howtos/authentication[documented here]
* Caches such as `ProducerCache` and `EndpointRegistry` can now be
purged from link:camel-jmx.html[JMX].
* Added stats for number of redeliveries and handled failures to JMX.
* Added support for link:camel-jboss.html[JBoss 6].
* link:jms.html[JMS] consumer uses `CACHE_AUTO` for default cache level.
This ensure that it will automatic detect if its transacted and use
`CACHE_NONE` which must be used for transacted. And `CACHE_CONSUMER` for
non transacted.
* Improved link:splitter.html[Splitter] in parallel mode to be more
responsive when aggregating on-the-fly under high load, and reducing
number of threads in-use.
* Added `onPrepare` to link:multicast.html[Multicast],
link:splitter.html[Splitter], link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List],
and link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] to execute custom logic when preparing
messages. For example you can use that to deep clone message bodies, or
enrich messages before they are processed.
* Added `CamelSqlQuery` header to link:sql-component.html[SQL Component]
to specify (per exchange) SQL query.
* `camel-cache` now works in OSGi.
* Fixed an issue with link:hawtdb.html[HawtDB] file store growing to
large.
* Added `repeatCount` option to link:timer.html[Timer] so you can limit
the number of times it fires.
* Consuming from link:jms.html[JMS] will now uses default exchange ids,
instead of overring and uses ids based on `JMSMessageID`. This makes
exchange ids consistent with all components in Camel.
* The `camel-script` component now works in OSGi and being able to
discover and use `ScriptEngineFactory` from bundles.
* link:restlet.html[Restlet] producer now supports the
link:asynchronous-routing-engine.html[Asynchronous Routing Engine]
* link:throttler.html[Throttler] now uses an
link:expression.html[Expression] for the maximum messages per period,
which means it can be adjusted dynamic at runtime.
* link:cache.html[Cache] now supports replicating cache across nodes
using listeners.
* link:cache.html[Cache] headers are now prefixed with 'CamelCache' and
use mixed case, also they are removed from the exchange after a cache
operation is performed
* Fixed issue with link:xmpp.html[XMPP] being redeployed (hot-deploy) in
Apache ServiceMix may fail.
* link:cxf.html[CXF] uses case-insensitive keys for CXF protocol
headers, which Apache CXF itself also uses.
* Fixed issue with stopping context scoped link:error-handler.html[Error
Handler] if a route was stopped, for example using
link:camel-jmx.html[JMX].
* Updated documentation of each link:eip.html[EIP] to include a table
with the options they support.
* Improved the link:aws-sqs.html[AWS-SQS], link:aws-sns.html[AWS-SNS]
and link:aws-s3.html[AWS-S3] components to be able to configure the
region with which the Amazon client wants to work with.
* Improved the link:aws-s3.html[AWS-S3] component to be able to set the
content length and content type of streamed objects.
* The `testConnectionOnStartup` option on link:jms.html[JMS] now also
checks JMS producers as well.
* Upgraded link:cometd.html[Cometd] from 1.0.1 to 2.1.0
* link:message-filter.html[Message Filter] EIP now fail on startup if it
was mis-configured in XML DSL
* Fixed issue with link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router]
in link:scala-dsl.html[Scala DSL] not evaluating as
link:predicate.html[Predicate]s.
* Improved the link:jdbc.html[JDBC] component to not leave the database
in an inconsistent state if one of multiple updates fails.
* Fixed issue with link:jms.html[JMS] consumer may report a class cast
exception at WARN level during processing a message.
* Removed not needed type conversion attempts by `camel-jaxb`, when
routing messages to link:bean.html[Bean]s, for JAXB annotated payloads
* Optimized routing with link:bean.html[Bean] slightly
* Fixed an issue when restarting routes with scheduled polling consumers
having `consumer.xxx` properties configured. The `consumer.xxx`
properties would be lost on restart.
* Added fallback to link:file2.html[File] component, to do a copy/delete
if a native file rename fails. This may happen if you rename files
between different file systems such as linux -> shared windows
directory.
* Minor improvements to link:scala-dsl.html[Scala DSL]
* link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] EIP will now by default uses eager
completion check when grouped exchange has been enabled.
* Internal Camel caches now uses a
http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ref/SoftReference.html[SoftReference]
which allows the JVM to be able to garbage collection from the cache in
case its running out of memory. This should help Camel end users when
running in low memory systems.
* Added 2 new link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel Maven Archetypes]
for OSGi using spring-dm or blueprint
* The link:log.html[Log] component will now by default *not* show stream
message bodies. Use the new `showStreams` option to enable that
explicit.
* Improved startup time of Camel by hard loading type converters from
`camel-core` JAR
* Made unit testing the Camel link:source.html[Source] go faster
* The Camel link:testing.html[test kit] will now by default lazy load
type converters which makes unit testing faster for most tests.
* Added new features to link:advicewith.html[AdviceWith] to support
`weaveByType`, selectors, and a shorthand to easily add nodes to
start/end of routes.
* link:camel-test.html[Camel Test] support setting up
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] once per test class, instead of
every test method. This can speedup testing when having multiple test
methods in the same unit test class.
* Fixed an issue with link:ftp2.html[FTP] producer not trying to
re-connect if pre write check fails. By re-connecting the producer can
recover and process the message without failing.
* link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] can now show the routes as XML on the
CamelContext/Route mbeans. Likewise route(s) can be updated/added from
XML as well.
* link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] added operations to
`ManagedCamelContext` to send messages which has headers as well.
* link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] added operations to `BrowsableEndpoint`
mbeans to show message in generic XML format.
* The JDBC and JPA based idempotent repositories now contains a
createdAt property/column.
* Improved the link:aws-sqs.html[AWS-SQS] component to change all queue
attributes (VisibilityTimeout, MaximumMessageSize,
MessageRetentionPeriod and Policy) at a later time if needed.
* Aligned the authentication and proxy parameter names so
link:http4.html[HTTP4] uses same names as link:http.html[HTTP]
component.
* Removed some very seldom used expression builders in Java DSL that
caused a minor problem with being able to render the routes as XML. By
removing those we ensure the routes creating using Java DSL can
accurately render itself as XML DSL routes.
* Added link:hazelcast-component.html[Hazelcast] as supported store for
the link:idempotent-consumer.html[Idempotent Consumer] EIP
* link:tracer.html[Tracer] uses same logic as link:log.html[Log]
component for extracting message body. By default they will not
log/trace message bodies from stream/files. But instead indicate its a
stream/file message body. You can control this behavior by setting a
property on the link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext].
* Added monitor type consumer to link:jmx.html[JMX] consumer. This new
style of consumer automatically creates and deploys a monitor bean
(counter, gauge, or string) to monitor the specified attribute of an
existing bean. This is useful for cases where a route wants to monitor a
bean without relying on an pre-existing deployment and configuration of
a monitor.
* Added link:ref-language.html[Ref Language] to make it easy to refer
and use custom link:expression.html[Expression] in XML DSLs.
* You can provide additional arguments to
link:scripting-languages.html[Scripting Languages] as a header on the
Camel Message.
* Added support for setting custom properties in the endpoint uri for
link:cxf.html[CXF] by using `properties.` as prefix, eg
`properties.mtom-enabled=true` to enable MTOM. This is usable if you
configure and use link:cxf.html[CXF] from Java DSL. The XML DSL has a
specialized CXF schema to configure this using XML tags.
* Added option `disableTimeToLive` on link:jms.html[JMS] to force
disabling time to live value. Added more details in link:jms.html[JMS]
documentation about the need for synchronizing clocks for
link:jms.html[JMS] systems when doing request/reply, and why the option
`disableTimeToLive` may come handy.
* link:spring-web-services.html[Spring Web Services] producer now
propagates headers correctly.
* Components loading resources such as link:velocity.html[Velocity],
link:xslt.html[XSLT], link:xquery.html[XQuery],
link:freemarker.html[FreeMarker] etc. now leverages Camels
link:pluggable-class-resolvers.html[Pluggable Class Resolvers] which
ensures they now work in link:using-osgi-blueprint-with-camel.html[OSGi
Blueprint].
* `DefaultPackageScanClassResolver` uses a JAR cache to speedup scanning
JARs. This ensures Camel bootup faster, in case it re-scan JARs from the
cache.
* Exposed Restlet API in link:restlet.html[Restlet] to allow end users
to be in full control. For example using the `org.restlet.Response`
instance to populate the response from a link:restlet.html[Restlet]
route.
* Splited camel transport for cxf out of camel-cxf module. If you want
to use camel transport for cxf or the cxfbean component, you need to add
the dependency of camel-cxf-transport.
* link:aggregator2.html[Aggregate] EIP will restore timeout values from
existing exchanges from aggregation repository upon start. This ensures
that restarting Camel, will allow the aggregator trigger timeouts for
those existing exchanges.
* link:bean.html[Bean] component:
link:parameter-binding-annotations.html[Parameter Binding Annotations]
are now also inherited from superclasses and interfaces.
* Fixed routes using a link:content-based-router.html[Content Based
Router] not having its child nodes enlisted in link:camel-jmx.html[JMX]
for management.
* Fixed parent/child relationship in
link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router] to be more fine
grained.
* Fixed issue related to non optional camel-core dependency on
javax.script in OSGi.
* Added option `shareUnitOfWork` to link:splitter.html[Splitter],
link:multicast.html[Multicast], and link:recipient-list.html[Recipient
List] to make the entire operation appear as one unit of work, that
either succeed or failure. This underpins some use cases, especially
with the link:splitter.html[Splitter] and using a
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] to only store one
failed link:exchange.html[Exchange] (one unit of work).
* Exceptions thrown while handling other exceptions in
link:exception-clause.html[OnException] will now caught by a fallback
error handler logging to 2nd exception and propagating the 2nd exception
on the link:exchange.html[Exchange] and causing that
link:exchange.html[Exchange] to break out processing and fail
immediately. This avoids complications, what to do if a exceptions occur
while handling a previous exception. For example you could end up going
in circles. Now its predictable (Log the 2nd and fail).
* link:exception-clause.html[OnException] will fail on startup if it has
been misconfigured (eg its empty, such as
`onException(Exception.class);`). You must either add redelivery
settings, handled, continued, retryWhile, outputs, etc. to configure it
* Fixed issue when sending link:mail.html[Mail] as Camel could
mistakenly drop characters from `Content-Type` header. Improved how
`charset` is parsed and configured in the `Content-Type` header.
* The `ScheduledPollingConsumer` now rigorously catches all erros in the
scheduled thread to avoid the thread from terminating by the JDK
scheduled thread pool, causing the scheduled polling to stop. Added
option `runLoggingLevel` to configure logging level for logging
start/complete logs when the polling task runs.
* Fixed issue with link:bean.html[Bean] endpoint propagating
`CamelBeanMethodName` header. This header was only intended for the
first link:bean.html[Bean] endpoint, and not any subsequent
link:bean.html[Bean] endpoints.
* link:spring-web-services.html[Spring Web Services] consumer now
propagates exceptions back to Spring-WS. This allows for exception
handling by Spring-WS EndpointExceptionResolver's
* Optimized Camel's routing engine by moving the need for defensive copy
of link:exchange.html[Exchange] during routing, to the
link:error-handler.html[Error Handler]s instead (which is capable of
performing redelivery). Optimized to only perform defensive copy if
redelivery has been enabled.
* Fixed issue with link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] doing
redelivery, the passed in link:exchange.html[Exchange] could have left
over state from the previous attempt.
* link:seda.html[SEDA] now supports suspend/resume
link:lifecycle.html[Lifecycle], which for example is a more gentle way
for temporary pausing link:seda.html[SEDA] routes.
* Fixed issue with link:routepolicy.html[ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy]
in context scope may not trigger to resume routes, when
link:exchange.html[Exchange]s started from other independent routes,
were completed.
* Added `ManagementObjectStrategy` as SPI to make it easier to reuse all
the various MBeans created by Camel, or to plugin a custom strategy if
needed.
* Improved link:smpp.html[SMPP] to be able to return error codes to the
SMSC in case of failures by processing the incoming message. This is
useful e.g. to instruct the SMSC to redeliver the short message.
* Camel link:mail.html[Mail] component now supports marking mails as
SEEN/DELETED after processing when using the pop3 protocol.
* Fixed issue using link:content-enricher.html[Content Enricher] or
link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer] with
link:batch-consumer.html[Batch Consumer] could cause the consumer to
keep polling after usage. For example a link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumer
would keep polling the FTP server.
* link:content-enricher.html[Content Enricher] using `pollEnrich` will
now set an empty message body if the link:content-enricher.html[Content
Enricher] could not poll from the resource. Previously the old message
body would be preserved.
* Add fragment property on the link:jaxb.html[Camel JAXB] dataformat.
* In addition of http://karaf.apache.org[Apache Karaf] features
descriptor, Camel now provides a link:karaf.html[Karaf] shell commands
to manipulate link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext], routes, etc.
* link:mock.html[Mock] endpoint now accepts multiple expected
headers/properties using the `expectedHeaderReceived` /
`expectedPropertyReceived` methods.
* Added the `changed` read lock option to the link:ftp2.html[FTP]
component.
* Added `minDepth` and `maxDepth` options to link:file2.html[File]
component.
* Fixed issue using link:smpp.html[SMPP] with messages longer than 254
characters.
* Upgraded link:amqp.html[AMQP] to use Apache QPid 0.10
* Fixed issue if having multiple routes on the exact same
link:jms.html[JMS] topic endpoint, and if removing one of the routes,
causing the other active routes to not receive any more messages from
the JMS topic.
* Fixed issue when endpoint uris had multiple values for same parameter
key, would only keep last parameter. For example if using
link:http.html[HTTP], link:http4.html[HTTP4] to send a HTTP request to a
remote HTTP server and having parameters in the URI with multiple values
for the same key, eg such as
`"http://someserver.com?from=me&to=foo&to=bar"`
* Improved link:ref.html[Ref] component to throw better failure
exceptions if the endpoint could not be found in the
link:registry.html[Registry]
* Introduced `mapMailMessage` option (default true) to Camel
link:mail.html[Mail] that determines if Camel should map the raw mail
message to headers/bodies etc.
* link:ahc.html[AHC], link:http.html[HTTP], link:http4.html[HTTP4],
link:jetty.html[Jetty], link:servlet.html[SERVLET] now supports multi
valued HTTP headers.
* Lookup bean with expected type in link:registry.html[Registry] now
reports better exception message with actual and expected type in case
of a caused `ClassCastException`
* link:type-converter.html[Type Converter] discovery has been improved
to be faster and better support different runtimes. Camel now prefers to
load @Converter classes using the FQN class name instead of package
scanning. Package scanning is a costly procedure and doesnt work out of
the box in all runtimes, and using
link:pluggable-class-resolvers.html[Pluggable Class Resolvers] is needed
to make that work.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[Camel2.8.0Release-APIbreaking]]
API breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added `purge` method to `ServicePool`
* If you use link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] from within a
link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router] in Java DSL, then
you need to use `end()` to indicate the end of the
link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap]. See this
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/CBRWithWireTapTest.java[test]
* `WireTapDefinition` no longer extends from `SendDefinition`
* Removed `maximumRequestsPerPeriod` attribute on
link:throttler.html[<throttle>] in XML DSL. You should use an
link:expression.html[Expression] instead, such as
`<constant>10</constant>`
* link:cache.html[Cache] headers are now prefixed with 'CamelCache' (see
CacheConstants) and are removed from the exchange after the cache
operation is performed
* link:scala-dsl.html[Scala DSL] uses 'Camel case names' for its DSL to
be consistent and aligned with the Java DSL
* The `sendBody` and `requestBody` methods on `ManagedCamelContext` have
changed signature to use a `java.lang.Object` type in the 2nd parameter.
Instead we have introduced `sendStringBody` and `requestStringBody` that
has a `java.lang.String` type in the 2nd parameter. For example you can
use those from JConsole.
* The JDBC and JPA based idempotent repositories now contains a
createdAt property/column.
* The authentication and proxy parameter names have been renamed in the
link:http4.html[HTTP4] component. See the link:http4.html[HTTP4] page
for details.
* Removed seldom used methods on EIPs that uses an `ExpressionClause` to
build up an expression. There are other existing methods that accept an
`Expression` as parameter to be used instead:
** `completionPredicate()` on `AggregationDefinition`
** `onWhen()` on `CatchDefinition`
** `expression()` on `IdempotentConsumerDefinition`
** `onWhen()` on `OnCompletionDefinition`
** `onWhen()` on `OnExceptionDefinition`
** `idempotentConsumer()` on `ProcessorDefinition`
** `expression()` on `SplitDefinition`
** `onWhen()` on `TryDefinition`
** `expression()` on `WhenDefinition`
* Removed the deprecated `handled` methods on
link:error-handler.html[Error Handler]. If you used `handled(false)` on
the link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] you would have to migrate to
using link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] instead that support
`handled`.
* `GZIPHelper` moved from
link:http.html[HTTP]/link:http4.html[HTTP4]/link:ghttp.html[ghttp]
components to `camel-core`
* Removed `org.apache.camel.spi.ScriptEngineResolver`
* `org.apache.camel.component.cxf.CxfHeaderFilterStrategy` moved from
`camel-cxf` to `camel-cxf-transport` as
`org.apache.camel.component.cxf.common.header.CxfHeaderFilterStrategy`
* Added `removeEventNotifier` method to `ManagementStrategy`
* Added getter/setter for `ManagementObjectStrategy` on
`ManagementStrategy`
* Moved the exception `ProxyInstantiationException` from the package
`org.apache.camel.impl` to `org.apache.camel`
* Added parameter `depth` to the method `pollDirectory` in the class
`GenericFileConsumer`

[[Camel2.8.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The link:tracer.html[Tracer] may not output all details for some
situations such as when using `onCompletion` or `intercept` etc.
* Using link:debugger.html[Debugger] and link:tracer.html[Tracer] at the
same time is not working.
* Not all link:examples.html[Examples] have ANT build.xml files to run
the example using ANT.
* The project cannot fully build the site using Maven (eg running
`"mvn site"`. There is no plan to make this work as the project do not
use the maven site.
* The following two unit tests may fail on Windows from the `camel-ftp`
component: `FtpChangedReadLockTest` and `FtpChangedReadLockTimeoutTest`.

[[Camel2.8.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Upgraded to slf4j 1.6.1
* Upgraded to Apache CXF 2.4.0 (CXF 2.3.x or older is no longer
supported)
* The `testConnectionOnStartup` option on link:jms.html[JMS] now also
checks JMS producers as well.
* Fixed `InterceptStrategy` to pass in actual `OutputDefinition`. For
example in a route with a link:splitter.html[Splitter], it would now
pass in the children of the splitter, in the
`wrapProcessorInInterceptors` method.
* The link:log.html[Log] component will now by default *not* show stream
message bodies. Use the new `showStreams` option to enable that
explicit. Likewise the link:log.html[Log] component will *not* automatic
convert the payload to `StreamCache`. For that you need to explicit
enable link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] on the route or
CamelContext.
* Removed the artifacts `camel-spring-tests.jar` and
`camel-blueprint-tests.jars` from being released to
http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/[Maven Central Repository].
* Upgraded to use Commons Net 2.2 (was 2.0) in link:ftp2.html[FTP]
component.
* Splited Camel transport for link:cxf.html[CXF] out of `camel-cxf`
module. If you want to use camel transport for link:cxf.html[CXF] or the
`cxfbean` component, you need to add the dependency of
`camel-cxf-transport`.
* Upgraded link:spring-web-services.html[Spring Web Services] to release
2.0.2 from 1.x.
* Exceptions thrown while handling other exceptions in
link:exception-clause.html[OnException] will now caught by a fallback
error handler logging to 2nd exception and propagating the 2nd exception
on the link:exchange.html[Exchange] and causing that
link:exchange.html[Exchange] to break out processing and fail
immediately. This avoids complications, what to do if a exceptions occur
while handling a previous exception. For example you could end up going
in circles. Now its predictable (Log the 2nd and fail).
* The default option `useFixedDelay` has been changed from `false` to
`true` in the link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumers.
* The `CamelBeanMethodName` header on a Camel message will not be
propagated routing through link:bean.html[Bean] components. The
link:bean.html[Bean] component will remove the header after usage.
* link:content-enricher.html[Content Enricher] using `pollEnrich` will
now set an empty message body if the link:content-enricher.html[Content
Enricher] could not poll from the resource. Previously the old message
body would be preserved.
* Added field `routeId` to trace event message in camel-core and
link:jpa.html[JPA].
* Upgraded to Scala 2.9.0 in `camel-scala` and `camel-web`
* End users with custom components that has
link:type-converter.html[Type Converter]s should consider migrating to
use the FQN in the `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/TypeConverter`
file. See more details at link:type-converter.html[Type Converter].
* If you use link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] in Java DSL, then you need to
add `.end()` to mark where it ends, as shown in this
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/branches/camel-2.8.x/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/CBRWithWireTapTest.java[unit

* The default cacheLevel on JMS is now CACHE_AUTO, which reacts
differently depending whether transacted=true or not. See more details
at link:jms.html[JMS] page.

[[Camel2.8.0Release-Notice]]
Notice

* The ANT support for the link:examples.html[Examples] is to be
considered deprecated. Support for ANT will be removed in the next
release. We may keep ANT supported for a single example, though.
