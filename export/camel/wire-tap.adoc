Wire Tap
^^^^^^^^

http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/WireTap.html[Wire Tap]
(from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns])
allows you to route messages to a separate location while they are being
forwarded to the ultimate destination.

Streams

If you link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] a stream message body then you
should consider enabling link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] to
ensure the message body can be read at each endpoint. See more details
at link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching].

[[WireTap-Options]]
Options
^^^^^^^

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Default |Description
|`uri` |  a|
*Mandatory:* The URI of the endpoint to which the wire-tapped message
should be sent.

From *Camel 2.16*: support for dynamic *`to`* URIs is as documented in
http://camel.apache.org/message-endpoint.html[Message Endpoint.]

|`executorServiceRef` |  a|
Reference ID of a custom link:threading-model.html[Thread Pool] to use
when processing the wire-tapped messages.

When not set, Camel will use an instance of the default thread pool.

|`processorRef` |  a|
Reference ID of a custom link:processor.html[Processor] to use for
creating a new message.

See "*Sending a New Exchange*" below.

|`copy` |`true` |*Camel 2.3*: Whether to copy the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] before wire-tapping the message.

|`onPrepareRef` |  |*Camel 2.8:* Reference identifier of a custom
link:processor.html[Processor] to prepare the copy of the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] to be wire-tapped. This allows you to do
any custom logic, such as deep-cloning the message payload.

|`cacheSize` |  a|
*Camel 2.16:* Allows to configure the cache size for
the **`ProducerCache`** which caches producers for reuse. Will by
default use the default cache size which is *`1000`*.

Setting the value to *`-1`* allows to turn off the cache all together.

|`ignoreInvalidEndpoint` |`false` a|
*Camel 2.16:* Whether to ignore an endpoint URI that could not be
resolved.

When *`false`*, Camel will throw an exception when it identifies an
invalid endpoint URI.

|=======================================================================

[[WireTap-WireTapThreadpool]]
WireTap Threadpool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] uses a thread pool to process the
tapped messages. This thread pool will by default use the settings
detailed at link:threading-model.html[Threading Model]. In particular,
when the pool is exhausted (with all threads utilized), further wiretaps
will be executed synchronously by the calling thread. To remedy this,
you can configure an explicit thread pool on the link:wire-tap.html[Wire
Tap] having either a different rejection policy, a larger worker queue,
or more worker threads.

[[WireTap-WireTapNode]]
WireTap Node
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel's Wire Tap node supports two flavors when tapping an
link:exchange.html[Exchange]:

* With the traditional Wire Tap, Camel will copy the original
link:exchange.html[Exchange] and set its
link:exchange-pattern.html[Exchange Pattern] to *`InOnly`*, as we want
the tapped link:exchange.html[Exchange] to be sent in a fire and forget
style. The tapped link:exchange.html[Exchange] is then sent in a
separate thread so it can run in parallel with the original. Beware that
only the Exchange is copied - Wire Tap won't do a deep clone (unless you
specify a custom processor via *`onPrepareRef`* which does that). So all
copies could share objects from the original Exchange.
* Camel also provides an option of sending a new
link:exchange.html[Exchange] allowing you to populate it with new
values.

[[WireTap-SendingaNew]]
Sending a New link:exchange.html[Exchange]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]* +
Camel supports either a processor or an link:expression.html[Expression]
to populate the new link:exchange.html[Exchange]. Using a processor
gives you full power over how the link:exchange.html[Exchange] is
populated as you can set properties, headers, etc. An
link:expression.html[Expression] can only be used to set the *`IN`*
body.

From *Camel 2.3*: the link:expression.html[Expression] or
link:processor.html[Processor] is pre-populated with a copy of the
original link:exchange.html[Exchange], which allows you to access the
original message when you prepare a new link:exchange.html[Exchange] to
be sent. You can use the *`copy`* option (enabled by default) to
indicate whether you want this. If you set *`copy=false`*, then it works
as in *Camel 2.2* or older where the link:exchange.html[Exchange] will
be empty.

Below is the processor variation. This example is from *Camel 2.3*,
where we disable *`copy`* by passing in *`false`* to create a new, empty
link:exchange.html[Exchange].\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/WireTapUsingFireAndForgetTest.java}Here
is the link:expression.html[Expression] variation. In the following
example we disable copying by setting *`copy``=false`* which results in
the creation of a new, empty
link:exchange.html[Exchange].\{snippet:id=e2|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/WireTapUsingFireAndForgetTest.java}*Using

is the link:expression.html[Expression] variation, where the expression
is defined in the *`body`*
tag:\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/SpringWireTapUsingFireAndForgetTest.xml}This
variation accesses the body of the original message and creates a new
link:exchange.html[Exchange] based on the
link:expression.html[Expression]. It will create a new Exchange and have
the body contain
`"Bye ORIGINAL BODY MESSAGE HERE"`\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/SpringWireTapUsingFireAndForgetCopyTest.xml}

tap test case].

[[WireTap-UsingDynamicURIs]]
Using Dynamic URIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.16:*

For example to wire tap to a dynamic URI, then it supports the same
dynamic URIs as documented in link:message-endpoint.html[Message
Endpoint]. For example to wire tap to a JMS queue where the header ID is
part of the queue name:

from("direct:start") .wireTap("jms:queue:backup-$\{header.id}")
.to("bean:doSomething");

 

[[WireTap-SendingaNewandSetHeadersinDSL]]
Sending a New link:exchange.html[Exchange] and Set Headers in DSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.8*

If you send a new message using link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap], then you
could only set the message body using an
link:expression.html[Expression] from the DSL. If you also need to set
headers, you would have to use a link:processor.html[Processor]. From
*Camel 2.8*: it's possible to set headers as well using the DSL.

The following example sends a new message which has

* *`Bye World`* as message body.
* A header with key *`id`* with the value *`123`*.
* A header with key *`date`* which has current date as value.

The XML DSL is slightly different than Java DSL in how you configure the
message body and headers using *`<body>`* and
*`<setHeader>`*:\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/SpringWireTapNewExchangeTest.xml}
