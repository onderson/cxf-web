Web Console
-----------

*Deprecated*

[Warning]
====


The web console module from Apache Camel distribution is deprecated and
will be removed from Camel 2.16 onwards. +
Instead we encourage users to look at some of the alternative console
projects, which some are listed in the bottom of this page.

====

The Camel Web Console is available from versions 2.0 onwards and
provides a full access over a RESTful API to camel endpoints, messages
and routes.

[Info]
====
 **Camel 2.5 or better**

The link:web-console.html[Web Console] from Camel 2.5 onwards requires
JDK 1.6 as minimum to run.

[[WebConsole-RESTAPI]]
REST API
~~~~~~~~

Camel comes with a full RESTful API for interacting with the Camel
context, the available endpoints and routes. You can browse details of
the running API via http://localhost:8080/api

The web application uses mostly the same URIs for the HTML
representation of a resource (e.g. */endpoints*) as the JSON and XML
representations. To help rendering the different representations in your
browser you can append *.xml*, *.html*, *.json* or even *.dot* to URLs.

For example viewing these URLs are equivalent

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|================================================
|URL |Same as
|http://localhost:8080/endpoints.xml a|
 

http://localhost:8080/endpoints

with Accept header of text/xml or application/xml

|http://localhost:8080/endpoints.json a|
 

http://localhost:8080/endpoints

with Accept header of application/json

|http://localhost:8080/routes.dot a|
 

http://localhost:8080/routes

with Accept header of text/vnd.graphviz

|================================================

For more details try viewing the http://localhost:8080/api[API
documentation in your local Camel instance]

[[WebConsole-RouteViewingandEditingthroughWebConsole]]
