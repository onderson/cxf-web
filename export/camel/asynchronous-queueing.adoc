For details see the discussion on
http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CAMEL/SOA+Patterns[Asynchronous
Queueing on the SOA Patterns site].

To implement asynchronous queueing just send a message to an async
endpoint like link:jms.html[JMS] or link:seda.html[SEDA].

You can also force
http://camel.apache.org/using-exchange-pattern-annotations.html[InOnly
message exchange patterns using an annotation] if you are using
something like link:spring-remoting.html[Spring Remoting]
