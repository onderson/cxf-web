Route Throttling Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.1*

[[RouteThrottlingExample-About]]
About
^^^^^

This example shows how to use the new feature
link:routepolicy.html[RoutePolicy] to dynamically at runtime to throttle
routes based on metrics gathered by the current number of inflight
exchanges.

What it means is that Camel will dynamic throttle the routes based on
the flow of messages being processed at runtime.

The example have 3 routes where as two of the routes are input routes,
and the last is the processing route +
1. route1: from("jms") - input from a JMS queue +
2. route2: from("file") - input from a file folder +
3. route3: from("seda") - processing of the input messages, this one
simulates CPU work by delaying the messages 100 mills.

[[RouteThrottlingExample-Howitworks]]
How it works
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the example runs we have a dependency from the routes as follows:

* route1 -> route3
* route2 -> route3

What the example demonstrates is that Camel is capable of dynamic
throttling route1 and route2 based on the total flow of messages. At
runtime Camel gathers the current inflight exchanges in a registry which
is used for metrics.

So when the flow is going _too fast_ then the
link:routepolicy.html[RoutePolicy] kicks in and `suspends` route1 and/or
route2. The current inflight exchanges will continue to be processed and
when we are below a _threshold_ then the
link:routepolicy.html[RoutePolicy] kicks in again and `resumes` route1
and/or route2.

Camel provides the throttling policy in the
`org.apache.camel.impl.ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy`.

[[RouteThrottlingExample-Howtorun]]
How to run
^^^^^^^^^^

The example has 3 maven goals to run the example

`mvn compile exec:java -PCamelServer` - starts the Camel Server which
contains the 3 routes and where you should check its log output for how
it goes.

`mvn compile exec:java -PCamelClient` - is a client that sends 10000 JMS
messages to the JMS broker which is consumed by route1. The Server must
be started beforehand.

`mvn compile exec:java -PCamelFileClient` - is a client that creates
5000 files that are consumed by route2. The server may be started
beforehand, but its not required.

So at first you start the server. Then at any time you can run a client
at will. For example you can run the JMS client and let it run to
completion at the server. You can see at the server console logging that
it reports the progress. And at sometime it will reach 10000 messages
processed. You can then start the client again if you like.

You can also start the other client to create the files which then let
the example be a bit more complicated as we have concurrent processing
of JMS messages and files at the same time. And where as both of these
should be dynamic throttled so we wont go _too fast_.

[[RouteThrottlingExample-Howtochange]]
How to change
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can check the file
`src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/camel-server.xml` file where you can
see the configuration of the dynamic throttler. By default its
configured as:

You can then change this and restart the server to see the changes in
effect.

[[RouteThrottlingExample-JMXmanagement]]
JMX management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At runtime you can manage the `ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` at runtime
as its listed under services in the JConsole. +
For example you can change the option `maxInflightExchanges` while its
running to find a more suitable value.

The screenshot below illustrates it from a JConsole. +
image:route-throttling-example.data/throttling%20services.png[image]

See more at link:camel-jmx.html[using JMX with Camel].

[[RouteThrottlingExample-Sampleoutputfromrunningexample]]
Sample output from running example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running the example you should see a lot of activity logged to the
console. +
Below is a snippet when the example runs to an end when the 10000
messages have been processed. What you should notice is that the
throttling ensures that the JMS consumer is not taking in more messages
than we can process. That means that ++JMS++ and ++SEDA++ are completing
at nearly the same time.

----

However if you run the example *without* the throttling you will notice
that the JMS consumer runs faster than we can process the messages.
Towards the end we have more than 2000 messages pending on the internal
SEDA queue, when the JMS consumer finishes.

So by using the `ThrottlingInflightRoutePolicy` we can throttle the
intake of messages to be on a pair with the speed we can process
messages. And since its pluggable you can implement your own custom
logic to throttle according to your needs.
