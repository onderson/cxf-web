**Work in progress**

The page intends to collect all ideas and proposals around the idea of a
Message Store as a architectural concept in Camel. No implementation has
started yet. You can participate by sharing your input here or post it
to the dev mailing list.

For the initial brainstorming on the dev mailing list, please check

thread].

We should make this EIP easier to use for end users, but offering a
better public API. And also have a pluggable message store, with filters
that can filter what should be stored. As well pluggable marshallers so
people can marshal data from Exchange into a format the message store
can store (BLOB, XML, JSon etc.). +
A Message Store could provide transparent persistence to various EIP
patterns (or used directly). Implementations would handle the mapping to
the underlying database or file system or NoSQL or memory or whatever. +
Message Store implementations are already there in various places, using
different approaches, like in Stream Caching (only file system),
AggregationRepository or IdempotentRepository. A Message Store is
requested for in other places like Reliable stream resequencing
(CAMEL-949) or Persistent Dead Letter Queue (CAMEL-4575).

[[Camel3.0-MessageStore-Summary]]
Summary
^^^^^^^

In Camel 2.x, a *Message Store* is not a "first class citizen" in the
sense of a architectural concept, which can be applied consistently
whereever needed. +
Camel 3.0 should introduce a unified, generic, pluggable Message Store
that consolidates the different approaches and allows to similarly
parameterize persistence to various EIP patterns. +
It should be usable independently of EIP patterns as well. +
Implementations would handle the mapping to the underlying persistence
layer, which can be InMemory, RDBMS, NoSQL-based etc. and can be chosen
based on the requirements towards reliability (survive system shutdowns
with losing messages) and scalability (reduce memory consumption when
processing many/big messages).

Side note: Spring Integration provides a

concept].

List of proposed features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Work in progress**

Feel free to add, edit, comment.... At some time we probably need to
assign priorities as to what is indispensable for Camel 3.0 and what
could be delivered in a later patch release

* Generically, entries in a Message Store can be created, updated, read
and deleted.
* Ability to temporarily store exchanges for the following EIPs:
** Aggregator, Multicast, RecipientList, Splitter : alternative to
AggregationRepository, making it eventually obsolete
** Streaming Resequencer (CAMEL-949)
** Stream Caching

** http://eaipatterns.com/StoreInLibrary.html[Claim check]
* Ability to store exchanges for a defined period of time
** Idempotent Consumer
** Dead Letter Queue (CAMEL-4575)
** Destination for the Tracer
* Ability to permanently store exchanges (e.g. for audit trails)
* Provide a certain level of manual retry. That is to get the original
message from the store and feed it back in the originating route.
* Flexibility to specify what part of an exchange should be stored (e.g.
what exchange properties and message headers) and in which format (e.g.
object serialization, JSON, using encryption)
* Possibility to provide a filter condition to determine which exchanges
should be stored (e.g. only failed exchanges, only with a certain
message header)
* Polling Consumer to randomly access a message store
* Producer to write an exchange into a message store

* There is a default message store defined for the Camel Context. This
can be overridden by a route-specific message store. This again can be
overridden by a specific EIP processor.

[[Camel3.0-MessageStore-MessageStoreData]]
Message Store Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to disambiguate stored exchanges and make them retrievable
again, message store entries must carry attributes in addition to the
marshaled exchange.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Item |Description/Reason
|ID |Generated unique ID of the entry

|Exchange |exchange (or parts thereof), usually in some marshalled form
(except in-memory stores)

|CamelContext |A message store may be used by several CamelContext
instances

|Correlation |Correlation ID to be able to aggregate related exchanges

|Source |Identifier that uniquely describes the point in the route from
which an exchange was stored. E.g. there might be more than one
aggregator processor in a route. Could also be used to manually or
automatically refeed exchanges back into the route

|Status |Status of an exchange (e.g. PROCESSING, DONE, FAILED)

|CreationTime |Timestamp when the entry was created

|ExpirationTime |Timestamp when the entry can be considered as expired
and picked up by some cleaning process

|... |... more?

[[Camel3.0-MessageStore-Codeexamples]]
Code examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Work in progress**

Sometimes it is easier to express thoughts by providing a fictional
piece of code along with some comments....

This section intends to demonstrate the usage of a Message Store by
providing hypothetical code snippets, e.g.

*AggregatorExample.java*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
...
from(...)
   .aggregate()
       .correlationExpression(header(id))
       .aggregationStrategy(myStrategy)
       .completionTimeout(10000)
       .messageStore(myStore)
...
----

[[Camel3.0-MessageStore-Claimcheck]]
Claim check

THe claim check pattern temporarily reduces the data volume of the
message by storing content in a message store in exchange for a claim
check token. The content is retrieved later on before it's needed again.

*Claim Check EIP store*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----

// Optionally: override default store from context
// (ohr:) IMHO I don't think that this configuration level is really necessary
defaultMessageStore(myStore);

// 1) Store body.
// 2) Set body to null.
// 3) Set Exchange.CLAIM_CHECK header to unique claim id.
from(...)
   .checkIn()  // store body in default store
   // .checkIn(header('bigHeader'), customStore) : store header in custom store 
   .to(...);
----

*Claim Check EIP read*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
// 1) Lookup for the Exchange.CLAIM_CHECK header value.
// 2) Read the message.
// 3) Set body to the value fetched from the store.
from(...)
   // .setHeader(Exchange.CLAIM_CHECK, const("id")) : header should still contain the claim id 
   .reclaim() // read body from default store
   // .reclaim().aggregationStrategy(myStrategy) : more generically using a aggregation strategy
   // .reclaim(customStore).aggregationStrategy(myStrategy) : reclaim from custom store using a aggregation strategy
   .to(...);
----

Open issues:

* exception handling if there's no data available for a specific token
* clean up of stale content that was never claimed back
* maybe return some kind of DataHandler instead of a token (cf. CXF MTOM
attachments) and retrieve content transparently?
