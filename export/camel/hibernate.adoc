Hibernate Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *hibernate:* component allows you to work with databases using
Hibernate as the object relational mapping technology to map POJOs to
database tables. The *camel-hibernate* library is provided by the
http://code.google.com/p/camel-extra/[Camel Extra] project which hosts
all *GPL related components for Camel.

[Info]
====


Note that Camel also ships with a link:jpa.html[JPA] component. The
link:jpa.html[JPA] component abstracts from the underlying persistence
provider and allows you to work with Hibernate, OpenJPA or EclipseLink.

[[Hibernate-Sendingtotheendpoint]]
Sending to the endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sending POJOs to the hibernate endpoint inserts entities into the
database. The body of the message is assumed to be an entity bean that
you have mapped to a relational table using the hibernate `.hbm.xml`
files.

If the body does not contain an entity bean, use a
link:message-translator.html[Message Translator] in front of the
endpoint to perform the necessary conversion first.

[[Hibernate-Consumingfromtheendpoint]]
Consuming from the endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consuming messages removes (or updates) entities in the database. This
allows you to use a database table as a logical queue; consumers take
messages from the queue and then delete/update them to logically remove
them from the queue.

If you do not wish to delete the entity when it has been processed, you
can specify `consumeDelete=false` on the URI. This will result in the
entity being processed each poll.

If you would rather perform some update on the entity to mark it as
processed (such as to exclude it from a future query) then you can
annotate a method with
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-hibernate/apidocs/org/apache/camel/component/hibernate/Consumed.html[@Consumed]
which will be invoked on your entity bean when the entity bean is
consumed.

[[Hibernate-URIformat]]
URI format
^^^^^^^^^^

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
hibernate:[entityClassName][?options]
----

For sending to the endpoint, the *entityClassName* is optional. If
specified it is used to help use the type conversion to ensure the body
is of the correct type.

For consuming the *entityClassName* is mandatory.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

[[Hibernate-Options]]
Options
^^^^^^^

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Default Value |Description
|`entityType` |_entityClassName_ |Is the provided _entityClassName_ from
the URI.

|`consumeDelete` |`true` |Option for HibernateConsumer only. Specifies
whether or not the entity is deleted after it is consumed.

|`consumeLockEntity` |`true` |Option for HibernateConsumer only.
Specifies whether or not to use exclusive locking of each entity while
processing the results from the pooling.

|`flushOnSend` |`true` |Option for HibernateProducer only. Flushes the
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html[EntityManager]
after the entity bean has been persisted.

|`maximumResults` |`-1` |Option for HibernateConsumer only. Set the
maximum number of results to retrieve on the
http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Query.html[Query].

|`consumer.delay` |`500` |Option for HibernateConsumer only. Delay in
millis between each poll.

|`consumer.initialDelay` |`1000` |Option for HibernateConsumer only.
Millis before polling starts.

|`consumer.userFixedDelay` |`false` |Option for HibernateConsumer only.
Set to `true` to use fixed delay between polls, otherwise fixed rate is
used. See
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html[ScheduledExecutorService]
in JDK for details.
