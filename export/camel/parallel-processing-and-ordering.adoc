Parallel Processing and Ordering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is a common requirement to want to use parallel processing of
messages for throughput and load balancing, while at the same time
process certain kinds of messages in order.

[[ParallelProcessingandOrdering-Howtoachieveparallelprocessing]]
How to achieve parallel processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can send messages to a number of Camel
link:components.html[Components] to achieve parallel processing and load
balancing such as

* link:seda.html[SEDA] for in-JVM load balancing across a thread pool
* link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ] or link:jms.html[JMS] for distributed
load balancing and parallel processing
* link:jpa.html[JPA] for using the database as a poor mans message
broker

When processing messages concurrently, you should consider ordering and
concurrency issues. These are described below

[[ParallelProcessingandOrdering-Concurrencyissues]]
Concurrency issues
++++++++++++++++++

Note that there is no concurrency or locking issue when using
link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ], link:jms.html[JMS] or link:seda.html[SEDA]
by design; they are designed for highly concurrent use. However there
are possible concurrency issues in the link:processor.html[Processor] of
the messages i.e. what the processor does with the message?

For example if a processor of a message transfers money from one account
to another account; you probably want to use a database with pessimistic
locking to ensure that operation takes place atomically.

[[ParallelProcessingandOrdering-Orderingissues]]
Ordering issues
+++++++++++++++

As soon as you send multiple messages to different threads or processes
you will end up with an unknown ordering across the entire message
stream as each thread is going to process messages concurrently.

For many use cases the order of messages is not too important. However
for some applications this can be crucial. e.g. if a customer submits a
purchase order version 1, then amends it and sends version 2; you don't
want to process the first version last (so that you loose the update).
Your link:processor.html[Processor] might be clever enough to ignore old
messages. If not you need to preserve order.

[[ParallelProcessingandOrdering-Recommendations]]
Recommendations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This topic is large and diverse with lots of different requirements; but
from a high level here are our recommendations on parallel processing,
ordering and concurrency

* for distributed locking, use a database by default, they are very good
at it

* to preserve ordering across a JMS queue consider using
http://activemq.apache.org/exclusive-consumer.html[Exclusive Consumers]
in the link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ] component
* even better are http://activemq.apache.org/message-groups.html[Message
Groups] which allows you to preserve ordering across messages while
still offering parallelisation via the *JMSXGroupID* header to determine
what can be parallelized
* if you receive messages out of order you could use the
link:resequencer.html[Resequencer] to put them back together again

A good rule of thumb to help reduce ordering problems is to make sure
each single can be processed as an atomic unit in parallel (either
without concurrency issues or using say, database locking); or if it
can't, use a http://activemq.apache.org/message-groups.html[Message
Group] to relate the messages together which need to be processed in
order by a single thread.

[[ParallelProcessingandOrdering-UsingMessageGroupswithCamel]]
Using Message Groups with Camel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use a Message Group with Camel you just need to add a header to the
output JMS message based on some kind of
link:correlation-identifier.html[Correlation Identifier] to correlate
messages which should be processed in order by a single thread - so that
things which don't correlate together can be processed concurrently.

For example the following code shows how to create a message group using
an XPath expression taking an invoice's product code as the
link:correlation-identifier.html[Correlation Identifier]

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("activemq:a").setHeader(JmsConstants.JMS_X_GROUP_ID, xpath("/invoice/productCode")).to("activemq:b");
----

You can of course use the link:xml-configuration.html[Xml Configuration]
if you prefer
