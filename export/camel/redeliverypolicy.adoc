RedeliveryPolicy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A redelivery policy defines rules when Camel
link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] perform redelivery attempts. For
example you can setup rules that state how many times to try redelivery,
and the delay in between attempts, and so forth.

You can use redelivery policies at two places in Camel:

* link:error-handler.html[Error Handler]
* link:exception-clause.html[onException]

For example you can define a default error handler to redelivery at most
3 times

java errorHandler(defaultErrorHandler().maximumRedeliveries(3));

And in XML

xml <errorHandler id="defaultEH"> <redeliveryPolicy
maximumRedeliveries="3"/> </errorHandler>

See more details at link:error-handler.html[Error Handler].

Extensive coverage

The Camel link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] is covered in great
details in the link:books.html[Camel in Action book] where the entire
chapter 5 has been devoted.

Using RedeliveryPolicyProfiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.7*

In the XML snippet below we have defined a `<redeliveryPolicyProfile>`
which we can refer to from the `<errorHandler>`.

\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/SpringErrorHandlerRedeliveryPolicyProfileTest.xml}

Camel's link:properties.html[Properties] placeholder is also supported
which the following XML example shows:

\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/properties/SpringPropertiesComponentOnExceptionRefTest.xml}

And you can also use Spring Frameworks property placeholders as shown
below:

\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/properties/SpringPropertyPlaceholderOnExceptionRefTest.xml}
