Weather Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.12*

The *weather:* component is used for polling weather information from
http://openweathermap.org[Open Weather Map] - a site that provides free
global weather and forecast information. The information is returned as
a json String object.

Camel will poll for updates to the current weather and forecasts once
per hour by default. It can also be used to query the weather api based
on the parameters defined on the endpoint which is used as producer.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-weather</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

[[Weather-URIformat]]
URI format
^^^^^^^^^^

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
weather://<unused name>[?options]
----

[[Weather-REMARK]]
REMARK
^^^^^^

Since the 9th of October, an Api Key is required to access the
openweather service. This key is passed as parameter to the URI
definition of the weather endpoint using the appid paramÂ !

[[Weather-Options]]
Options
^^^^^^^

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Default |Description
|`appid` |null |*Camel 2.16.1/2.15.5:* APPID ID used to authenticate the
user connected to the API Server. This key is required.

|`location` |`null` |If null Camel will try and determine your current
location using the geolocation of your ip address, else specify the
city,country. For well known city names, Open Weather Map will determine
the best fit, but multiple results may be returned. Hence specifying and
country as well will return more accurate data. If you specify "current"
as the location then the component will try to get the current latitude
and longitude and use that to get the weather details. You can use lat
and lon options instead of location.

|`lat` |`null` |Latitude of location. You can use lat and lon options
instead of location.

|`lon` |`null` |Longitude of location. You can use lat and lon options
instead of location.

|`period` |`null` |If null, the current weather will be returned, else
use values of 5, 7, 14 days. Only the numeric value for the forecast
period is actually parsed, so spelling, capitalisation of the time
period is up to you (its ignored)

|`headerName` |`null` |To store the weather result in this header
instead of the message body. This is useable if you want to keep current
message body as-is.

|`mode` |`JSON` |The output format of the weather data. The possible
values are `HTML`, `JSON` or `XML`

|`units` |`METRIC` |The units for temperature measurement. The possible
values are `IMPERIAL` or `METRIC`

|`consumer.delay` |`3600000` |Delay in millis between each poll (default
is 1 hour)

|`consumer.initialDelay` |`1000` |Millis before polling starts.

|`consumer.userFixedDelay` |`false` |If `true`, use fixed delay between
polls, otherwise fixed rate is used. See
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html[ScheduledExecutorService]
in JDK for details.
|=======================================================================

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

[[Weather-Exchangedataformat]]
Exchange data format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel will deliver the body as a json formatted java.lang.String (see
the `mode` option above).

[[Weather-MessageHeaders]]
Message Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Header |Description
|`CamelWeatherQuery` |The original query URL sent to the Open Weather
Map site

|`CamelWeatherLocation` |Used by the producer to override the endpoint
location and use the location from this header instead.

[[Weather-Samples]]
Samples
^^^^^^^

In this sample we find the 7 day weather forecast for Madrid, Spain:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("weather:foo?location=Madrid,Spain&period=7 days&appid=APIKEY").to("jms:queue:weather");
----

To just find the current weather for your current location you can use
this:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("weather:foo?appid=APIKEY").to("jms:queue:weather");
----

And to find the weather using the producer we do:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("direct:start")
  .to("weather:foo?location=Madrid,Spain&appid=APIKEY");
----

And we can send in a message with a header to get the weather for any
location as shown:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
  String json = template.requestBodyAndHeader("direct:start", "", "CamelWeatherLocation", "Paris,France&appid=APIKEY", String.class);
----

And to get the weather at the current location, then:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
  String json = template.requestBodyAndHeader("direct:start", "", "CamelWeatherLocation", "current&appid=APIKEY", String.class);
----
