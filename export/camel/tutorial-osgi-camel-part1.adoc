Introduction
------------

The focus of this Tutorial is to introduce you how you can create,
design a simple SOA solution using Camel and OSGI. Most of the current
and commercial SOA solutions rely on standards XML/WSDL/BPMN/BPEL and
Business Processes (designed through WYSIWYG editor like Eclipse or
propriatary product) which are deployed and orchestrated into a Business
Process Expression Language engine.

Such a solution can be envisaged for big companies because the
skills/time to market are important or when different development
standards exist inside the company like (Java, .NET).

In the 90's, such developments have been made using CORBA or COM+/DCOM
Microsoft technology. But both approaches had (and still have)
significant problems and limitations. Complexity is a big issue. Any of
the data that is passed requires very specific formatting, and many of
the rules for programming are simply too difficult to follow without
encountering errors. Even at the height of their popularity, CORBA was
used primarily in large system development staffed by legions of
programmers, while COM was used, often reluctantly, by teams of
Microsoft developers.

Open Standards Gateway Initiative provides a Java-based platform for
integrating both Java and non-Java application components. This
technology provides the standardized functions for constructing
applications from small, individual components and deploying them as a
single application. The core component of OSGi is the OSGi Framework.
The OSGi Framework is a very specific class-loading model. In addition
to its normal Java execution environment, this framework incorporates an
OSGi modules layer that adds private classes for modules and allows for
controlled linking between modules. The OSGi Framework also includes
life-cycle management for starting, stopping, adding and removing
modules, as well as a service registry for sharing objects between
modules.

Coupling the OSGI framework with a lightweight Enterprise Service Bus
will allow you easily to design the routing between your different
modules. A module can be a Plain Old Java Object (POJO), a Web Service
designed with Apache CXF framework, a component like an ordering system.
In fact, the module or bundle which is the term used by OSGI represent
the level of granularity that you identify for your application.

In this first part of the OSGI tutorial, we will show you how to:

* Create a simple service (derived from the
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-osgi[camel-osgi
example]) module (interface + implementation) and package it as a
bundle,
* Create a Camel context with a small routing and package it as a
separate bundle,
* The Camel routing will use an OSGI reference to call the simple
service

The link:tutorial-osgi-camel-part2.html[second part] of this tutorial
will be derived from the
link:tutorial-example-reportincident.html[Reporting incident tutorial]
and will show you how a more real application (which is web based) can
be re-scoped into a OSGI application.

**Tutorial is not up-to-date**

This tutorial was written when Camel 2.0 was just released and uses the
frameworks and libraries of that time. +
During 2010 the OSGi libraries and Camel itself has been improved a lot
and thus this tutorial is a bit out dated. +
At present time there is no plan to update this tutorial.

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-Prerequisites]]
Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses:

* Camel 2.0
* http://maven.apache.org/download.html[Maven 2.2.x] to setup the Camel
project and for dependencies for artifacts,
* http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/[Eclipse Ganymede 3.4.x],
* http://www.springsource.org/osgi[Spring Dynamic Modules for OSGI
1.2.0]
* http://felix.apache.org/site/downloads.cgi[Apache Felix Karaf 1.0.0],
* http://www.springsource.org/dmserver[Spring DM Server 1.0.1]
* http://www.ops4j.org/projects/pax/construct/maven-pax-plugin/[Pax
maven plugin]

*Note:* The sample project can be downloaded, see the
link:tutorial-osgi-camel-part1.html[resources] section.

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-Step1:InitialProjectSetup]]
Step 1 : Initial Project Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, we create two eclipse projects using the maven archetype
'*pax:create-bundle'*. This archetype is helpful because it generates a
pom.xml file that we will use with maven goal(s) to create the:

* MANIFEST.MF file (file required and specifying the information about
the bundle to deploy on the OSGI server, dependency with another bundle,
version, ... )
* jar of the bundle to deploy on the server

**PAX Project**

More info about the PAX maven plugin can be found
http://wiki.ops4j.org/display/ops4j/Open+Participation+Software+for+Java[here].
PAX project does not include only maven but also tools to run, debug and
deploy web application. We will address them in the second part of the
tutorial and particularly the web integration

To create the *simple service project*, execute the following command in
your Unix/Dos console.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn org.ops4j:maven-pax-plugin:create-bundle -Dpackage=demo.service -DbundleGroupId=demo.service -DbundleName=demo.service-bundle -Dversion=0.1
----

Remark:

* According to your project, you can change the artifactId to point to
_com.mycompany.application.service_, and _groupId
com.mycompany.application_

To allow your project to be imported in Eclipse, execute the following
command in the directory demo.service-bundle.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn org.ops4j:maven-pax-plugin:eclipse
----

Â To create the *Camel project*, execute the following command

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn org.ops4j:maven-pax-plugin:create-bundle -Dpackage=demo.camel -DbundleGroupId=demo.camel -DbundleName=demo.camel-bundle -Dversion=0.1
cd demo.camel-bundle
mvn org.ops4j:maven-pax-plugin:eclipse
----

Two folders are created with the following name:

* demo.service-bundle
* demo.camel-bundle

Next, you import these projects into your favorite workspace of Eclipse.

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-Step2:Developtheinterface]]
Step 2 : Develop the interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developing an OSGI project could be 'potentially' time consuming
regarding to:

* The learning curve of the new technology to acquire,
* Packaging of the components, registering of the components,
* How to call the OSGI server? How Can I have access to the bundle
context?

You could figure out that developing OSGI is similar to develop EJB
components using EJB 1.0 specification. Remember that time when the only
way to design an enterprise solution was to use EJB with its proxy,
stub-skeleton classes, the protocol RMI/IIOP (blocked by most of the
firewall) for the communication between the client and the server, ...
and so on and so on

Luckily, this is not the case because the specification has tried to
avoid such pitfalls and interesting projects exist today to simplify our
life:

* http://incubator.apache.org/aries/aries-programming-model.html[Apache
Aries Blueprint] (Blueprint Container implementation of the OSGi
standardized version of Spring-DM)
* http://www.springsource.org/osgi[Spring Dynamic Modules] (Spring)
* http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-ipojo.html[iPOJO] (Apache
Felix)

The goals of these frameworks are to:

* Design the business logic as POJO,
* Inject dependency(ies) though IoC,
* Handle lifecycle of the bundle and its relation with BundleContext

Although this tutorial is based on Spring Dynamic Modules.

Remark : The OSGI specification v4R2 has been published recently and
contain the
http://www.osgi.org/Download/File?url=/download/r4v42/r4.cmpn.pdf[Blueprint
Container specification - RFC 124].

So now, it is time to create the interface that we will use in this
project. Open Eclipse environment if not already done and create a new
folder "service" in `src/main/java/demo` tree. Add the interface
`TransformService.java` and copy paste the code below:

*TransformService.java*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
package demo.service;

public interface TransformService {

    public Object transform(Object obj);

}
----

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-Step3:Createtheclassimplementingtheinterface]]
Step 3 : Create the class implementing the interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, we will create the class `TransformServiceImpl` implementing the
interface `TransformService` in the folder "impl" in
`src/main/java/demo/service/impl`.

*TransformServiceImpl.java*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
package demo.service.impl;

import java.util.Date;

import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;

public class TransformServiceImpl implements TransformService {
    private static final transient Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(TransformServiceImpl.class);
    private boolean verbose = true;
    private String prefix = "MyTransform";

    public Object transform(Object body) {
        String answer = prefix + " set body:  " + new Date();
        if (verbose) {
            System.out.println(">> call >> " + answer);
        }
        LOG.info(">> call >>" + answer);
        return answer;
    }

    public boolean isVerbose() {
        return verbose;
    }

    public void setVerbose(boolean verbose) {
        this.verbose = verbose;
    }

    public String getPrefix() {
        return prefix;
    }

    public void setPrefix(String prefix) {
        this.prefix = prefix;
    }
}
----

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-Step4:Createthespringconfigurationfiles]]
Step 4 : Create the spring configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step concerns the creation of the configuration files who will
allow to inject dependency and later the deployment of the bundle into
the OSGI server and its registration as a 'service'.

\a) Dependency Injection

Create the file `demo-service-bundle-contxt.xml` in the folder
`src/main/resources/META-INF/spring`

*demo-service-bundle-contxt.xml*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

  <!-- regular spring configuration file defining the beans for this
       bundle. The configuration of OSGi definitions is kept in a separate
       configuration file so that this file can easily be used
       for integration testing outside of an OSGi environment -->
    <bean id="transformService" class="demo.service.impl.TransformServiceImpl">
    </bean>
</beans>
----

\b) OSGI 'Injection'

Create the file `demo-service-bundle-contxt-osgi.xml` in the folder
`src/main/resources/META-INF/spring`

*demo-service-bundle-contxt-osgi.xml*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:osgi="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi.xsd">

    <osgi:service ref="transformService">
        <osgi:interfaces>
            <value>demo.service.TransformService</value>
        </osgi:interfaces>
    </osgi:service>

</beans>
----

The xml tag osgi:service will help to register our OSGI service top of
the OSGI server and will publish the interfaces as available for another
bundles who would like to use them.

*Remark:* for more information about Spring Dynamic Modules and
configuration, I recommend to read its
http://static.springframework.org/osgi/docs/1.2.0/reference/html/[documentation]
and of course the http://www.osgi.org/Download/Release4V42[OSGI R4v2]
specification integrating 'blueprint container'

**Spring configuration files**

Two XML files have been created to work with Spring beans and Spring
OSGI beans separately (as proposed by
http://static.springframework.org/osgi/docs/current/reference/html/appendix-archetype.html[spring]
- section D.1 Generated Project Features at-a-glance) but you can also
merge the content in one file.

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-Step5:Generatethejarofthebundle]]
Step 5 : Generate the jar of the bundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, that the code and the configuration files are ready, we will use
maven to generate the `MANIFEST.MF` file describing the information
about our bundle, its version number, the package to export or import,
etc.

Remark : We use maven to avoid to create manually the MANIFEST file.

Before to execute the command, the pom.xml file must be modified like
this :

*pom demo.service-bundle*

This command can be launched from Eclipse (if you have integrated maven
within Eclipse (http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/[eclipse maven plugin]))
or a Unix/Dos prompt in the folder where your pom.xml file is located:

----
mvn clean install org.ops4j:maven-pax-plugin:eclipse
----

If this command does not report any error, then a 'MANIFEST.MF' file
containing the following information is created in the folder 'META-INF'
and +
a `demo.service-bundle-0.1.0.jar` jar is created in the `target` folder:

**bnd tool**

This file is created because the POM.file contains the maven

plugin] which uses the tool http://www.aqute.biz/Code/Bnd[bnd]. Bnd
stands for BuNDle tool and has been created by Peter Kriens (OSGi
Technical Officer)

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-Step6:CreatetheCamelcontextfileandOSGIdependency]]
Step 6 : Create the Camel context file and OSGI dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step is quite simple for Camel users because we will create two
configurations files, one containing the routing and the other with a
reference to our TransformationService deployed in a OSGI bundle.

* For the routing, create the following file in the folder
`src/main/resources/META-INF/spring` of the project `demo.camel-bundle`:

*CamelContext.xml*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd
       http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring
       http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring/camel-spring-2.0.0.xsd">

  <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
      <from uri="timer://myTimer?fixedRate=true&amp;period=10000"/>
      <bean ref="myTransform" method="transform"/>
      <to uri="log:ExampleRouter"/>
    </route>
  </camelContext>
</beans>
----

The routing defined here is a timer which will trigger every 10th second
and call the POJO 'MyTransform' and send the result to the 'camel:log'
component. As, you can see, this is a pure Camel configuration file
without any reference to an OSGI bundle

* To inject the dependency, we will create a second file named
`bundle-context-osgi.xml` in the same folder:

*bundle-context-osgi.xml*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:osgi="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi"
  xsi:schemaLocation="
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi.xsd">

      <osgi:reference id="myTransform" interface="demo.service.TransformService"/>

</beans>
----

Remarks:

* The id of the bean referenced `myTransform` used by the Camel context
has a reference to the OSGI interface `demo.service.TransformService`
* How could we imagine something more simplest? We don't have to call a
JNDI server with a reference or something like that. Only a reference to
the service interface.

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-Step7:Generatethemanifestandjarfile]]
Step 7 : Generate the manifest and jar file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to run/launch the command generating the MANIFEST file, you must
modify the pom.xml file in order to allow the OSGI bundle to import/use
the services classes : demo.service

*pom demo.camel-bundle*

Run the command `mvn clean install org.ops4j:maven-pax-plugin:eclipse`
(= Repeat step #5).

and check that the MANIFEST file created looks like the following :

The most important point that we see in this file is that we will import
the package demo.service allowing Camel mediation router to have access
to the service Transform exposed as an OSGI service by the bundle
demo.service.

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-Step8:Deploythebundles]]
Step 8 : Deploy the bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will show you now that we can easily deploy our bundles in two OSGI
servers running a different OSGI kernel:

* Apache Felix Karaf
* Equinox for Spring Dynamic Module

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-ApacheFelixKaraf]]
Apache Felix Karaf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned in the documentation,
http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-karaf.html[Apache Felix Karaf]
is a small OSGi based runtime which provides a lightweight container
onto which various components and applications can be deployed.
Moreover, the server provides administration, security, logging and
provisioning features who will help you during the deployment and
administration steps.

Here is the list of features provided by the osgi server :

* Hot deployment: Karaf supports hot deployment of OSGi bundles by
monitoring jar files inside the
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CAMEL&title=home&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=103709[home]/deploy
directory. Each time a jar is copied in this folder, it will be
installed inside the runtime. You can then update or delete it and
changes will be handled automatically. In addition, the Karaf also
supports exploded bundles and custom deployers (blueprint and spring
ones are included by default).
* Dynamic configuration: Services are usually configured through the
ConfigurationAdmin OSGi service. Such configuration can be defined in
Karaf using property files inside the
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CAMEL&title=home&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=103709[home]/etc
directory. These configurations are monitored and changes on the
properties files will be propagated to the services.
* Logging System: using a centralized logging back end supported by
Log4J, Karaf supports a number of different APIs (JDK 1.4, JCL, SLF4J,
Avalon, Tomcat, OSGi)
* Provisioning: Provisioning of libraries or applications can be done
through a number of different ways, by which they will be downloaded
locally, installed and started.
* Native OS integration: Karaf can be integrated into your own Operating
System as a service so that the lifecycle will be bound to your
Operating System.
* Extensible Shell console: Karaf features a nice text console where you
can manage the services, install new applications or libraries and
manage their state. This shell is easily extensible by deploying new
commands dynamically along with new features or applications.
* Remote access: use any SSH client to connect to Karaf and issue
commands in the console
* Security framework based on JAAS
* Managing instances: Karaf provides simple commands for managing
multiple instances. You can easily create, delete, start and stop
instances of Karaf through the console.
* Supports the latest OSGi 4.2 containers: Apache Felix Framework 2.0.0
and Eclipse Equinox 3.5

If this is not yet done, download Apache Felix Karaf 1.0.0 server and
install it. Launch the server by executing the command in the `bin`
folder:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
c:\apache-felix-karaf-1.0.0\bin>karaf
----

If this is the first time that Karaf is started, then you will see that
a new data folder is created under the root folder. This folder will
contain the bundles installed at the startup of the server

In order to allow our bundles (demo.service and demo.camel) to work with
Apache Camel framework, execute the following commands to download and
install the 'Camel and Spring bundles':

\1. Add camel feature file

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
karaf@root> features:addUrl mvn:org.apache.camel.karaf/features/2.0.0/xml/features
----

This new feature file contains the list of camel bundles to be
installed. This will avoid that you install each required bundle (= jar)
separately though the command osgi:install

\2. Install bundles using feature command

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
karaf@root> features:install spring
karaf@root> features:install spring-dm
karaf@root> features:install camel-core
karaf@root> features:install camel-spring
karaf@root> features:install camel-osgi
----

Verify that your list of bundles is complete using command osgi:list

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
karaf@root> osgi:list

----

Next, copy the our two jar into the `deploy` folder, first the service
and next the Camel bundle.

OR

install them using the command :

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
servicemix> osgi:install \-s mvn:demo.service/demo.service-bundle/0.1
servicemix> osgi:install \-s mvn:demo.camel/demo.camel-bundle/0.1
----

After a few seconds, you should see on the Karaf log console the
following text:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
>> call >> MyTransform set body:  Mon Dec 01 11:02:28 CET 2008
----

Remarks :

* In case of trouble, use the command: `osgi:list` to see if all the
deployed bundles are installed correctly and have their status equals to
active
* To see the log of Karaf, use the command: `log:display`

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-SpringDMserver]]
Spring DM server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spring DM server compare to ServiceMix Kernel, Eclipse Equinox or Apache
Felix is much more than a OSGI server. This is a completely module-based
Java application server that is designed to run enterprise Java
applications and Spring-powered applications with a new degree of
flexibility and reliability. It offers a simple yet comprehensive
platform to develop, deploy, and service enterprise Java applications.

We have decided to it inside this tutorial not only because we have
designed spring-based applications but because we are convince that OSGI
platform will become the next standard for the Web Application Server.
Existing Commercial and open-source are gradually migrating their
servers to support OSGI.

Like ServiceMix Kernel, start the Spring DM server by launching the
following command in your Unix/Dos environement :

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
c:\springsource-dm-server-1.0.0.RELEASE\bin>startup
----

When the server is started, open your favorite browser and point to the
following url `http://localhost:8080/admin` using 'admin' as login and
'springsource' as password. In the administration page, click on the
button "browse" to upload the different jars to be deployed. Select the
folder where you have copied the following jars and upload them one by
one (by respecting the order)

* http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/servicemix/bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.jaxb-impl/2.1.6_1/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.jaxb-impl-2.1.6_1.jar[org.apache.servicemix.bundles.jaxb-impl-2.1.6_1.jar]

* http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/camel/camel-core/1.6.0/camel-spring-1.6.0.jar[camel-spring-1.6.0.jar]
* demo.service-bundle-0.1.jar
* demo.camel-bundle-0.1.jar

When the bundles are uploaded, the screen is refreshed and shows a list
of the deployed applications like this :

[width="100%",cols="20%,20%,20%,20%,20%",options="header",]

To verify that the Camel service bundle works perfectly, open the
trace.log file located in the folder :

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
c:\springsource-dm-server-1.0.0.RELEASE\serviceability\trace\demo.demo.camel-bundle-0.1\trace.log
----

and you should see the following text

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part1-Conclusion]]
Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

Well, we have finished the first part of the tutorial. Even if the
example is simple, we have introduced very important concepts and show
you how to design a small SOA solution, package it and deploy it under
two different OSGI servers. I'm really sure that in a near future a
maven plugin will be created to facilitate this task and will automate
the deployment within your favorite OSGI servers.
