If I use ServiceMix when should I use Camel?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Camel is a routing and mediation engine which works great inside
link:jbi.html[JBI].

So if you are already using http://servicemix.apache.org/[ServiceMix]
then you can use Camel implement the
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] inside link:jbi.html[JBI] such as
link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router], routing messages
between your existing JBI endpoints.

You can also reuse any of the Camel link:components.html[Components]
within JBI or expose Camel endpoints as JBI endpoints.
