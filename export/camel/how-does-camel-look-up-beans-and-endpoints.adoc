How does Camel look up beans, components or endpoints?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many times using Camel that a name is used for a bean such as
using the link:bean.html[Bean] endpoint or using the
link:bean-language.html[Bean Language] to create a
link:expression.html[Expression] or link:predicate.html[Predicate] or
referring to any link:component.html[Component] or
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint].

Camel uses the link:registry.html[Registry] to resolve names when
looking up beans or components or endpoints. Typically this will be
link:spring.html[Spring]; though you can use Camel without Spring in
which case it will use the link:jndi.html[JNDI] registry implementation.

Lots of test cases in the camel-core module don't use Spring (as
camel-core explicitly doesn't depend on spring) - though test cases in
camel-spring do.

So you can just define beans, components or endpoints in your
link:registry.html[Registry] implementation then you can refer to them
by name in the link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] URIs or link:bean.html[Bean]
endpoints or link:bean-language.html[Bean Language] expressions.
