Database
~~~~~~~~

Camel can work with databases in a number of different ways. This
document tries to outline the most common approaches.

[[Database-Databaseendpoints]]
Database endpoints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel provides a number of different endpoints for working with
databases

* link:jpa.html[JPA] for working with hibernate, openjpa or toplink.
When consuming from the endpoints entity beans are read (and
deleted/updated to mark as processed) then when producing to the
endpoints they are written to the database (via insert/update).
* link:ibatis.html[iBATIS] similar to the above but using
http://ibatis.apache.org/[Apache iBATIS]
* link:jdbc.html[JDBC] similar though using explicit SQL
* link:sql-component.html[SQL] useshttp://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/jdbc.html[spring-jdbc]
behind the scene for the actual SQL handling. The difference between
this component and http://camel.apache.org/jdbc.html[JDBC] component is
that in case of SQL the query is a property of the endpoint and it uses
message payload as parameters passed to the query

[[Database-Databasepatternimplementations]]
Database pattern implementations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Various patterns can work with databases as follows

* link:idempotent-consumer.html[Idempotent Consumer]
* link:aggregator.html[Aggregator]
* link:bam.html[BAM] for business activity monitoring
