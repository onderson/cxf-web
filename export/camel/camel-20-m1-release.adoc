[[Camel2.0-M1Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the first milestone 2.0-M1 release of the new Apache Camel
project, including 368 issues resolved (new features, improvements and
bug fixes such as...)

* Introduced link:type-converter.html[type converter registry] to allow
end users to programmatic get access to this registry
* major improvements to link:jetty.html[Jetty] for better handling of
exception/faults and easier end-user customization how response should
be written
* major improvements to link:file2.html[File] for consuming files, now
supporting pluggable sorting, filtering and idempotent repositories.
* major refactor and improvements to link:ftp2.html[FTP], aligning it
with the link:file2.html[File] component.
* minor improvements to link:jdbc.html[JDBC], link:sql.html[SQL],
link:http.html[Http] and link:mina.html[Mina]
* major refactor and improvements to link:cxf.html[CXF] component. 
CxfBinding, HeaderFilterStrategy, Bus can be looked up from registry and
configured at the endpoint level.
* link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] producers added option
to write files using a temporary name and then rename it to the real
name after the write completes
* link:ftp.html[SFTP] added support for knownhosts and privatekey files
* link:mail.html[Mail] now supports setting additional SUN java mail
properties
* link:mina.html[Mina] now supports setting text line delimiters for
textline codec.
* link:mina.html[Mina] producer now throws CamelExchangeException in
case no response received from remote server when in sync mode
(sync=true)
* RedeliveryPolicy added support for ref attribute to reference a
existing policy in the link:registry.html[Registry]
* link:dead-letter-channel.html[RedeliveryPolicy] added `delayPattern`
option for using a special pattern for setting different delay based on
intervals
* Added `onWhen` and `retryUntil` predicates to
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause]
* link:list.html[List] component renamed to link:browse.html[Browse]
* link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] is much smarter as it
will use caused by exception hierarchy for matching as well (will use
bottom ups)
* link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] and
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] now have `onRedeliver` to
allow custom processing an link:exchange.html[Exchange] *before* its
being redelivered. Allowing you to work on the message being sent.
* Added support for link:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.html[# syntax in
Endpoint URI's] to allow endpoint URI's to refer to bean in the
link:registry.html[Registry].
* `consumer.` prefix can be omitted for scheduled polling consumers such
as link:file2.html[File], link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumers. Thus the URI
options is more simpler and you don't have to remember which requires
`consumer.` prefix and which doesn't.
* link:tracer.html[Tracer] improved to allow custom routing and
processing of TraceEventMessage so you can store trace logs as you like,
for instance in a database.
* link:tracer.html[Tracer] now also displays the previous node so you
can see where the Exchange is coming from.
* link:quartz.html[Quartz] has added support for stateful jobs.
* Introduced @FallbackConverter for using annotation based fallback type
converters
* Extended link:content-enricher.html[content enrichment] support via
the link:content-enricher.html[enrich] DSL element.
* link:simple.html[Simple] language now supports a basic set of
operators.
* link:aggregator.html[Aggregator] now supports grouped exchanges out of
the box, so you can combine all aggregated exchanges into a single
grouped exchange going out.
* Multiple inputs can be define as input to routes:
`from("activemq:queue:order", "file://order").to("bean:handleOrder");`
* CXF component supports a new "cxfbean" endpoint that allows RESTful
requests to be routed to JAXRS annotated service beans.
* Setting cron expression in camel-quartz improved.
* Better handling of interrupts while shutting down.
* The JMSReplyTo destination is available as Exchange property when
consuming JMS messages.
* Better support for `InOptionalOut` Message Exchange Pattern.
* link:pluggable-class-resolvers.html[Pluggable Class Resolvers] SPI for
class resolvers allowing third party platforms such as JBoss to provide
integration with Camel.
* Refined API to reduce package tangling.
* Introduced wireTap node for the link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] EIP
pattern.
* Added `fromF` and `toF` in the Java DSL to build uri strings using
String.format with arguments, e.g.:
`fromF("ftp://%s@myserver?password%s", user, password)..to`
* Improved tooling being able to retrieve more runtime information from
the `CamelContext`
* Scala DSL is improved
* `Message#getBody(Class type)` change to return `null` in case it
cannot convert. Use `#getMandatoryBody(Class type)` instead of you want
an exception to be thrown if convertions not possible.
* `.convertBodyTo(type)` now throws an `InvalidPayloadException` if the
payload cannot be converted.

[[Camel2.0-M1Release-AggregatorspecificationinSpringDSLchanged]]
Aggregator specification in Spring DSL changed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The aggregator expression is now enclosed in a correlationExpression
element. You now need to specify an aggregator as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]

[[Camel2.0-M1Release-JAXBdataformat]]
JAXB data format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use XJC to create the java class from the schema, you will get a
ObjectFactory for you JAXB context. Since the ObjectFactory uses
JAXBElement to hold the reference of the schema and element instance
value, from Camel 1.6.0 jaxbDataformat will ignore the JAXBElement by
default and you will get the element instance value instead of the
JAXBElement object form the unmarshaled message body. +
If you want to get the JAXBElement object form the unmarshaled message
body, you need to set the JaxbDataFormat object's ignoreJAXBElement
property to be false.
