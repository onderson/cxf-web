[[Camel2.5.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.5.0 release which approx 300 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Added `suspend/resume` operations to
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] for _warm_ restarts, or as the
preferred way to temporary stop a running Camel application, and then
later resume it. Those operations is also available in
link:camel-jmx.html[JMX].
* Improved management of routes in link:camel-jmx.html[JMX]. You can now
suspend/resume routes which support suspension. There is a new
`removeRoute` to remove a route from link:camel-jmx.html[JMX]. Routes
with `autoStartup=false` is now also listed in link:camel-jmx.html[JMX],
to allow you to start the routes manually.
* The link:asynchronous-routing-engine.html[Asynchronous Routing Engine]
allows to be forced into synchronous mode for certain components, by
specifying `synchronous=true` in the endpoint uri.
* link:ftp2.html[FTP] now supports MSV file systems. The ftp consumer
will now traverse the directory structure using a
`cd <dir>, list files in cur dir` pattern, as opposed to a
`list files <dir>` style.
* link:ftp2.html[FTP] improved support for consuming using absolute
paths.
* Fixed issue with using multiple link:http.html[HTTP] endpoints with
the only difference being `httpClient` parameters.
* Fixed issue with link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] and deleting
temporary files on Windows.
* Server thread pool settings can be configured on
link:jetty.html[Jetty] component.
* Easier to configure general HTTP/SSL socket connector properties on
link:jetty.html[Jetty] component.
* Fixed issue with sending an `InOut` message to
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] would cause Camel to
expect a reply. Now the message will always be send to the DLQ as
`InOnly`.
* Fixed issue when sending to a link:jms.html[JMS] destination, the
option `disableReplyTo` was not used.
* Added two new functions to link:xpath.html[XPath] to leverage
link:properties.html[Properties] component and link:simple.html[Simple]
language.
* Fixed issue when running link:jetty.html[Jetty] server under heavy
load throwing `IllegalStateException`
* link:jms.html[JMS] uses
link:asynchronous-routing-engine.html[Asynchronous Routing Engine] for
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] messaging over JMS.
* Fixed issue with a route could mistakenly pick up a route scoped
link:exception-clause.html[OnException] from another route.
* Fixed an issue with starting `CamelContext` after it had been
shutdown, leading to routes not properly being re-initialized and
started.
* The link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumers now
support using `preMove` together with either `noop` or `delete` options.
* Added support for `timeout` in link:recipient-list.html[Recipient
List], link:splitter.html[Splitter] and link:multicast.html[Multicast]
EIPs when running in parallel mode.
* Added support for 3rd part link:uuidgenerator.html[UuidGenerator].
* Reverted back to use ActiveMQ link:uuidgenerator.html[UuidGenerator]
as default generator. Its faster than the previous `JavaUuidGenerator`,
especially in high concurrent systems.
* link:velocity.html[Velocity] can now find template files from
filesystem/classpath when referring to them from other templates.
* Fixed issue with multiple link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] using
same id being mixed as single link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] in
link:camel-jmx.html[JMX]. Camel now fails to start if existing
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] already have been registered in the
MBeanServer.
* The link:message-filter.html[Message Filter] EIP now stores a property
on the link:exchange.html[Exchange] to indicate if it was filtered or
not.
* link:ftp2.html[FTP] supports sending site commands after successful
login.
* link:simple.html[Simple] language can now compare numeric values which
was entered as String types.
* Fixed limitation where link:content-enricher.html[PollEnrich] could
not poll from a file endpoint if the route started from a file endpoint
as well.
* Fixed limitation with link:simple.html[Simple] language, before you
could only use one `and` or `or` operator. Now you can use multiple
operators in the same expression.
* link:restlet.html[Restlet] component now supports using \{ }
placeholders in uri, which gets replaced with headers from
link:exchange.html[Exchange].
* Added `dynamicRouter` to the DSL to make it easier to do dynamic
routing using a link:bean.html[Bean] to evaluate _on-the-fly_ the next
destination(s).
* When sending a link:jms.html[JMS] message using InOnly but having a
`JMSReplyTo` header configured, then the `JmsProducer` will
lookup/create the JMS Destination to ensure its a valid `JMSReplyTo`
from the header.
* Endpoint uris containing password is not logged in plaintext, but is
now masked.
* link:properties.html[Properties] can now leverage
link:jasypt.html[Jasypt] allowing you to use encrypted values in your
properties files.
* Trimmed down the size of the link:web-console.html[Web Console]
reducing the number of jars and removing the groovy experimental editor.
It now requires JDK 1.6 to run as well. We will in the future improve
the link:web-console.html[Web Console] to contain more features and
information.
* Added new link:language.html[Language] component to execute
link:languages.html[Languages] scripts when sending a message to a
`language` endpoint. This makes it easier to support
link:dynamic-router.html[Dynamic Router] where small pieces of logic
must be executed as well.
* Added `charset` option on the link:file2.html[File],
link:ftp2.html[FTP] endpoint which dictates the encoding to use.
* link:cxf.html[CXF] consumer and link:cxfrs.html[CXFRS] consumer will
try to leverage CXF continuation API to call the camel process
asynchronous API if it is possible, and you can turn it off by setting
the `synchronous` option to `true`.
* link:cxf-bean-component.html[CXF Bean Component] now supports using
customer providers configured by the `providers` option on the
link:cxfrs.html[CXFRS] endpoint.
* Fixed `ConsumerTemplate` using `receiveBody` methods to complete
link:oncompletion.html[OnCompletion] beforehand. For example when using
a link:file2.html[File] endpoint and having set `delete=true`, which now
causes the file to be deleted.
* Fixed link:hawtdb.html[HawtDB] not working in OSGi
* Fixed dependency injection between `<bean>` and `<camelContext>`,
making it work as it did with Spring 2.5 when using Spring 3.0 instead.
The `<bean>` will be dependency injected before the `<camelContext>`.
* Optimized link:type-converter.html[Type Converter] when using
link:jetty.html[Jetty] routing and/or conversions to `String` types
which will fallback and lookup `PropertyEditor` editors.
* Added `LimitedPollingConsumerPollStrategy` for
link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer]s as a limited strategy
which suspends consumers which causes consecutive failures. For example
to avoid a faulty consumer to spam logs etc. Uses a limit of 3.
* Fixed link:jetty.html[Jetty] sending back HTTP headers using keys is
lower-case. Not it preserves the case of the keys, so it can be mixed
case.
* Added $simple\{ } as alternative syntax for tokens in the
link:simple.html[Simple] language to avoid clashing when using Springs
`PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer`. See example at the
link:file2.html[File] language page.
* Added `discardOnCompletionTimeout` option to
link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator]
* Fixed concurrency issue when using predicates using binary operators
such as `isEqualTo`.
* Total overhaul of the link:quickfix.html[Quickfix] component. Thanks
to the http://www.quickfixj.org/[QuickFIX/J] community for help.
* link:cxfrs.html[CXFRS] producer now leverages fallback type converter
which means its much easier for end users to grab the response body in a
type they want.
* link:mail.html[Mail] component now supports specifying emails using
`"Ibsen, Claus" <davsclaus@apache.org>` style.
* Fixed issue with link:ftp2.html[FTP] which could cause the polling to
stop without any hint in the logs why.
* Added `publishedEndpointUrl` option into the link:cxf.html[CXF]
component.
* `DefaultPackageScanClassResolver` supports to configure the url
schemes by using Spring configuration. To cater for Server's using
custom classloader schemes in URLs.
* Added option `lazyLoadTypeConverters` to
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] to configure if type converters
should be loaded lazy or on startup (default).

[[Camel2.5.0Release-APIbreaking]]
API breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Some methods on the link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP]
endpoint/producer has been promoted from `protected` to `public` to make
it easy from Java code to re-use the functionally of those methods,
without using it as a Camel component. Such as when you want to
communicate with a FTP server using the API from the
`RemoteFileOperations`.
* Added `changeToParentDirectory` method to `GenericFileOperations`.

[[Camel2.5.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The link:tracer.html[Tracer] may not output all details for some
situations such as when using `onCompletion` or `intercept` etc.
* Not all link:examples.html[Examples] have ANT build.xml files to run
the example using ANT.
* Project cannot be fully build using Maven 3.0
* One may encounter build errors in camel-ftp with java versions older
than "1.5.0_24"
* Dozer does not work in OSGi
* `camel-blueprint` is not fully feature complete (such as @Producer,
@Consume is not supported)
* `camel-blueprint` using <package> scan does not work
* Setting a custom TaskExecutor on link:jms.html[JMS] component using
Spring 2.5 does not work as `camel-jms` is compiled against Spring 3.0.
See more at
https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-3286[CAMEL-3286]
* `markRollbackOnlyLast` doesn't remove caused exception, which may
affect outer transaction to rollback as well. Likewise the logging of
`TransactionErrorHandler` may log the inner transaction as being
committed, when it was in fact rolled back.
* link:splitter.html[Splitter] using `parallelProcessing` may use a lot
of memory during processing, see
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3497[CAMEL-3497]

[[Camel2.5.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Support for link:jms.html[JMS] API 1.0.2 has been removed.
* The `stopRoute` method on `CamelContext` now leverages
link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful Shutdown] when stopping. This is
more intuitive to stop routes in a graceful and safe manner. You can the
stop method with a timeout if you want to force stopping, which was the
old behavior.
* The link:web-console.html[Web Console] now requires JDK 1.6 as minimum
to run.
* The artifacts `camel-core-tests.jar` and `camel-spring-tests.jar` has
been *deprecated* and will be removed in a future release. You should
always only use the `camel-test.jar` if you want to use the Camel Test
Kit.
* Camel will now fail to startup if an existing CamelContext has been
registered in JMX with the same id.
* If you did not set a id on `<camelContext>` it would have defaulted to
`camelContext`. This has been changed to be the auto assigned name it's
given by Camel, such as `camel-1`, `camel-2` etc.
* Maven version 2.2.1 or better is now required to build Camel from
source.
* If using link:quartz.html[Quartz] with jobs persisted in a database,
then mind that Camel now resolves job names based on endpoint uri,
_without_ parameters. This allows you to change cron parameters on the
same job (reschedule jobs).
* The `timeout` option on link:netty.html[Netty] has been removed as it
was flawed.
* Durable topic subscribers with link:jms.html[JMS] must now provide
`clientId`, otherwise Camel will fail fast on startup.
* The default link:uuidgenerator.html[UuidGenerator] has been changed
back to be ActiveMQ based. If you run in the cloud you may have to
configure to use the old default `JavaUuidGenerator` as the ActiveMQ may
use JDK API which is not accessible in the cloud.
* If you use the link:ftp2.html[FTP] component (consumers) make sure to
test it throughly as it has changed how it traverse the file structure.
* Upgraded to Spring 3.0.4
* Upgraded to CXF 2.2.11
