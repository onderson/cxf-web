What is a router?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We often talk about that Camel is a mediation and routing framework; so
what exactly is a router and what does it do?

Basically a router just consumes link:message.html[Message] exchanges
from some link:endpoint.html[Endpoint], then sends them on to some other
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] using some kind of
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns].

For example a router could implement the
link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router] pattern, to route
from an endpoint to one or more destination endpoints using a
link:predicate.html[Predicate] based on the message content.

Typically a route or router consists of one or more consumers; either an
link:event-driven-consumer.html[Event Driven Consumer] or a
link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer] or possibly a
link:transactional-client.html[Transactional Client]. Then there are one
or more link:processor.html[Processor] instances which could send the
message to one or more endpoints.
