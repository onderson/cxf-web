Camel proposes different solutions to allow your solution to be
scalable, to distribute the load between different instances. The choice
will depend on how you will deploy/package Camel (standalone mode,
embedded in a J2EE or OSGI server, ...) and how the servers will be
configured (master/slave, ...).

[[Clusteringandloadbalancing-Loadbalancing]]
Loadbalancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This approach allows to distribute the load between different endpoints.
The from endpoint plays the role of a 'proxy' when we use by example a
jetty server

[[Clusteringandloadbalancing-Clustering]]
Clustering
~~~~~~~~~~

The clustering can be achieved in different ways : Work distribution,
Consumer competition, ... depending how you would like to configure your
infrastructure (one or several instances running on the same machine or
distribute across a cloud of servers).

* Same JVM & CamelContext

Different Camel components can be used depending if the work must be
done in a sync or async way

* ** Without persistence

Async : link:seda.html[seda://] + threads()

Sync : link:direct.html[direct://] + threads()

* Same JVM but different CamelContext

This approach is suitable for solutions running in standalone mode or
deployed in Web Application Server (different WAR/EAR)

link:vm.html[vm://]

Remark : This component cannot be used between different OSGI servers

* ** With persistence

JMS queue engine : link:jms.html[jms://] + threads() +
Activemq queue engine : link:activemq.html[activemq://] + threads()

* Different JVM & CamelContext

When the infrastructure offers the possibility to deploy the application
on several machines, then you can use the approaches presented before.
That means means that you will deploy the same application on several
nodes and in this case, we have competitor consumers. Depending on the
load on the servers, messages can be consume by application 1 running on
Server 1 instead of application 2 running on Server 2.

If you prefer to deploy routes on servers having different CPU/memory,
then you can use the following components

* ** Within or between different instances of OSGI servers (SMX4)

Camel can be not only plugged on the NMR bus but can also use the
clustering functionality offered by ServiceMix 4 ()

* Cassandra +
It could be interesting to create a Cassandra endpoint to allow to
consume +
info/camel messages from Cassandra DB (NOSQL database) or to push
there +
camel message (using id + binary stream). It might also make an
interesting +
aggregator implementation since its also distributed & can support
multi-master

* Camel-terracotta +
Extends the SEDA component
