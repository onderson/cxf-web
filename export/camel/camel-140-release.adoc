[[Camel1.4.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 1.4.0 release which includes 261 new features,
improvements and bug fixes such as...

* major improvements in link:jms.html[JMS] and link:mail.html[Mail]
components
* major improvements in link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] management
(enabled by default)
* major improvements in link:transactional-client.html[Transactional
Client]. Bypassing link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel]
redelivery, letting the originator system handle this, resulting in the
JMSMessage is rolled back to the JMS queue.
* attachment support for link:message.html[Message]
* various improvements in link:cxf.html[CXF], link:file2.html[File],
link:ftp2.html[FTP], link:velocity.html[Velocity],
link:stream.html[Stream], link:atom.html[Atom] and link:xmpp.html[XMPP]
components
* various improvements in the Java and Spring DSL
* new transaction error handler, see
link:transactional-client.html[Transactional Client]
* introduced link:dead-letter-channel.html[ExceptionPolicyStrategy] as
strategy for exception clause selection during error handling (much
improved default strategy in Camel)
* intercept() default behavior changed (see section - important changes)
* JMS headers now preserve packagename style headers so
link:bean.html[Bean] and link:file2.html[File] headers is preserved, so
you can safely send the filename or bean method to invoke over the JMS
wire
* introduced link:debugger.html[Debugger] and link:tracer.html[Tracer]
interceptor to track how exchanges is routed
* refinements to run in OSGi containers
* some internal refactorings of package structure to avoid cycle
dependencies
* @deprecated some core classes, that will be removed in Camel 2.0
* improved feedback for misconfiguration of camel routes such as
mistypes of parameters
* overall improved wiki documentation
* improved javadoc for camel-core and camel-spring
* dependencies is now on the finer grained jars if applicable (e.g.
Spring)
* WebSphere 6.1 support

[[Camel1.4.0Release-APIbreakings]]
API breakings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Potentially there can be an API breaking when upgrading from Camel 1.3
or older. We are sorry for this and will try to refrain from such API
breakings in the future Camel 1.x releases. An API overhaul is scheduled
for Camel 2.0.

[[Camel1.4.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The link:tracer.html[Tracer] and link:log.html[Log] can cause a NPE if
the Message Body is `null`. A workaround is to configure it with
`showBody=false`.

[[Camel1.4.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[Camel1.4.0Release-CamelTemplatemarkedas@deprecated]]
CamelTemplate marked as @deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CamelTemplate has been marked as @deprecated and you should use
ProducerTemplate instead. +
From Camel 1.4.0 on the ProducerTemplate must be retrieved from the
CamelContext. You can then use it the same way as before.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
ProducerTemplate camelTemplate = camelContext.createProducerTemplate();
----

After usage of the template, you must call `stop()` to let it release
any resources obtained. See this
link:why-does-camel-use-too-many-threads-with-producertemplate.html[FAQ
entry].

[[Camel1.4.0Release-componentminorchange]]
link:bean.html[Bean] component minor change
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bean component sets a reference to the bean that is being invoked as a
property on the Exchange. This property has change its key from
"CamelBean" to "org.apache.camel.bean.BeanHolder" and the type is now a
BeanHolder.

[[Camel1.4.0Release-Unittestkits]]
Unit test kits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The unit test kits camel-core-tests.jar and camel-spring-tests.jar is no
longer distributed with the binary distribution. These jars can be
downloaded from maven repositories.

[[Camel1.4.0Release-JMX]]
JMX
^^^

In Camel 1.4 the link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] agent has been enabled
by default. To disable it, as the default in previous versions, you have
to explicitly disable it. See the link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX]
documentation for details.

[[Camel1.4.0Release-Defaultbehaviorofintercept()changed]]
Default behavior of intercept() changed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Camel 1.4 the DSL for intercept() has changed its default behavior to
proceed by default.

In Camel 1.3 you had to do this:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
intercept().log("log:orders").proceed();
from("direct:order").to("seda:verifyOrder");
...
----

In Camel 1.4 the proceed is default:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
intercept().log("log:orders");
from("direct:order").to("seda:verifyOrder");
...
----

And in Camel 1.3 stop was default:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
intercept(header("user").isEqualTo("test")).log("log:test");
from("direct:order").to("seda:verifyOrder");
...
----

In Camel 1.4 you have to explicit state the stop:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
intercept(header("user").isEqualTo("test")).log("log:test").stop();
from("direct:order").to("seda:verifyOrder");
...
----

In the last two examples we want to filter out all orders by a test
user. In Camel 1.4 we need to use the `stop()` to stop the intercept
chain from proceeding.

[[Camel1.4.0Release-URIvalidation]]
URI validation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel is now more strict when it comes to validation of URI
configuration. If a parameter name couldn't be resolved Camel will throw
an Exception. In this regard the link:file2.html[File] component you
must change the delay parameters to have the `consumer.` prefix. `delay`
should be `consumer.delay`.

[[Camel1.4.0Release-DeadLetterChannel]]
DeadLetterChannel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

link:dead-letter-channel.html[DeadLetterChannel] is now disabled if in
transacted mode. Use the new transaction error handler instread, see
link:transactional-client.html[Transactional Client].
