[[Camel2.14.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.14.0 release which approx 399 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Support for running on Java 1.8 JVMs
* Spring 4.x supported, camel-test-spring module can only work with
Spring 4.0.x and camel-test-spring3 module is for Spring3.x. Support for
testing with Spring 4.1 coming in Camel 2.15 onwards.
* link:rest-dsl.html[REST DSL] to define REST services using a REST
style with verbs such as get/post/put/delete etc. The Rest DSL supports
Java and XML DSL.
* link:rest-dsl.html[REST DSL] integrated with
link:swagger.html[Swagger] to expose the service as swagger apis.
* Simple language defined in routes using resultType as boolean is now
evaluated as predicate instead of as expression.
* Introduced RuntimeEndpointRegistry to capture runtime usage of
endpoints in use during routing, such as dynamic endpoints from dynamic
link:eip.html[EIP]s.
* Added event notification for routes added and removed.
* Allow to configure cache size in Recipient List, Routing Slip and
Dynamic Router EIPs; and as well turn caching off.
* link:netty-http.html[Netty HTTP] producer now supports the
CamelHttpPath header to define a dynamic context-path and query
parameters to call the remote http server.
* link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer] allows to configure
initial queue size and whether to block when full when using the
default `EventDrivenPollingConsumer` which most components does. We now
block by default, as otherwise the message may be lost if the queue was
full, and a new message was offered.
* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-7435[Added] a generic
callback to configure the link:apns.html[APNS] service builder.
* Added `StreamList` option to the link:jdbc.html[JDBC] component
* Allow to define Simple expressions for sql parameters of the
link:sql-component.html[SQL] component. +
* A new XML tokenizer that is truly XML-aware (e.g., supporting XML
namespaces and complex hierarchical structures)
* Added option `parallelAggregate` to link:multicast.html[Multicast],
link:splitter.html[Splitter] and link:recipient-list.html[Recipient
List] EIPs
* Support to set the variable map from message header in
link:velocity.html[Velocity], link:freemarker.html[Freemarker],
link:stringtemplate.html[StringTemplate].
* Added HazelcastInstance option
to link:hazelcast-component.html[Hazelcast] component.
* Producers from static link:eip.html[EIPs] such as <to> is is now also
enlisted in link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] when Camel is starting routes.
* Unmarshal json to pojo using `camel-jackson` now supports a header to
tell Camel what the pojo class name is, to allow more dynamic behavior,
as otherwise the class name would be hardcoded.
* Also allow to configure `camel-jackson` to skip null values, by
setting includes to `NOT_NULL`.
* And `camel-jackson` can now easily be configured to unmarshal to
a `List<pojo>` or `List<Map>` instead of either a single pojo or `Map`
type. 
* Introduced `SynchronizationRouteAware` allowing to have callbacks
before/after an Exchange is being routed. This allows to trigger custom
code at these points, for example after a route, but before a Consumer
writes any response back to a caller (InOut mode).
* link:jdbc.html[JDBC] now supports outputClass for SelectList type.
* Routes starting from link:jms.html[JMS] will now shutdown the consumer
(MessageListenerContainer) quicker when CamelContext is being stopped.
(assuming the acceptMessagesWhileStopping hasn't been set to true). This
can also help a cleaner shutdown as otherwise some JMS clients may
attempt re-connect/failover during shutdown which isn't desired anyway
as we are shutting down.
* link:oncompletion.html[OnCompletion] can now be configured to use or
not use a thread pool, and as well whether to run before or after the
route consumer. Running before the consumer allows to modify the
exchange before the consumer writes it as response to the callee (if
consumer is InOut mode) +
* Added Bulk Index message operation to
link:elasticsearch.html[Elasticsearch] component.
* Added link:routepolicy.html[RoutePolicyFactory] to create and assign
a `RoutePolicy` for every route, instead of having to configure this for
every route.
* https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CAMEL/Metrics+Component[MetricsRoutePolicyFactory] to
expose route statistics using the codehale metrics library.
* Improved `NettyWorkerPoolBuilder#build` https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-7583[visibility]. +
* The link:sjms.html[SJMS] component now uses Apache commons-pool for
the pool implementation instead of custom code.
* Using link:quartz2.html[Quartz2] as polling consumer
(QuartzScheduledPollConsumerScheduler) now supports task stored in JDBC
data store, which means users can setup quartz in clustered mode
* Camel component API to output json parameter schema now honors the
http://json-schema.org/[JSon Schema] spec, and also include a
description of the javaType for object types.
* link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Using PropertyPlaceholder] is now
supported in `<dataFormats>` in the XML DSLs
* Add support for Pattern, GroupingSeparator & DecimalSeparator to
link:bindy.html[camel-bindy] when parsing/formatting BigDecimal
* Added option aggregateOnException
to link:content-enricher.html[Content Enricher] to allow end users to
deal with exceptions in the aggregate method, such as suppressing the
exception or building a custom message, etc. 
* link:pojo-consuming.html[POJO Consuming] now shutdown eager during
stopping Camel, which ensures a graceful shutdown when using pojo
routing.
* link:bean.html[Bean] component caches the bean by default (eg a single
instance of the bean is reused). This can be turned off by setting
cache=false, which now enforces a new instance of the bean is created
and used once (no reuse, aka prototype scoped)
* Added support for RFC5424 to link:syslog.html[Syslog] and as well
having encoder/decoders for link:netty.html[Netty] out of the box.

[[Camel2.14.0Release-FixedIssues]]
Fixed Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Timer consumer is now scheduled after CamelContext has started all
routes, to ensure other routes is running when timer routes is triggered
to run.
* link:netty-http.html[Netty HTTP] now returns HTTP status 404 if
resource not found instead of 503.
* Fixed the
https://camel.apache.org/mongodb.html[MongoDB] `readPreference` option
which used to cause an `IllegalArgumentException` to be thrown.
* Fixed issue with Netty producer may leak HashWhealTimer instances when
having many producers that are not reused.
* Fixed issue with Netty consumer should wait for join to complete when
joining a multicast group over UDP 
* Improved stability when testing with `camel-test-blueprint` component.
* link:netty-http.html[Netty HTTP] now
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-7506[removes]
`headerFilterStrategy` option after resolving it
* Fixed link:aggregator2.html[POJO aggregating] when the parameter type
was referring to a type that was class annotated.
* Fixed link:mybatis.html[MyBatis] to keep the message body as-is when
calling stored procedures, if the procedure returns data as OUT
parameters.
* Fixed Camel Karaf commands to work with multiple CamelContext from the
same bundle.
* Fixed link:advicewith.html[Advice-With] to work with transacted routes
defined in XML DSL
* Fixed link:advicewith.html[Advice-With] to work with Content Based
Router when adding outputs to the when clauses.
* Fixed link:advicewith.html[Advice-With] to honor autoStartup option.
* Fixed link:oncompletion.html[OnCompletion] to route the
completed link:exchange.html[Exchange] even if it was marked to stop /
failed due exception / handled by error handler etc.
* Fixed using `@EndpointInject` with ref in `RouteBuilder` classes, to
enlist the endpoints in JMX during starting CamelContext when using OSGi
* Fixed Property Trigger.timerZone is declared as constant for
camel-quartz component but not implemented when endpoint is instantiated
* Fixed link:jpa.html[JPA] to not share `EntityManager` with concurrent
threads or other exchanges, as an `EntityManager` is not thread-safe
accordingly to the JPA spec.
* Fixed https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=26116344[MDC
Logging] to avoid losing MDC values after invoking an
Async-Routing-enabled endpoint.
* Fixed link:cxfrs.html[CXFRS] consumers to accept custom bindings.

[[Camel2.14.0Release-Changesthatmayaffectendusers]]
Changes that may affect end users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer] allows to configure
initial queue size and whether to block when full when using the
default `EventDrivenPollingConsumer` which most components does. We now
block by default, as otherwise the message may be lost if the queue was
full, and a new message was offered.
* `camel-scala` upgraded from Scala 2.10.x to 2.11.x
* The option `useSsl` has been removed from `camel-twitter` as ssl is
always enabled now, enforced by twitter
* Fixed link:restlet.html[Restlet] to return error code 405 (instead of
404 if a http method is not allowed
* Routes starting from link:jms.html[JMS] will now shutdown the consumer
(MessageListenerContainer) quicker when CamelContext is being stopped.
(assuming the acceptMessagesWhileStopping hasn't been set to true). This
can also help a cleaner shutdown as otherwise some JMS clients may
attempt re-connect/failover during shutdown which isn't desired anyway
as we are shutting down. If you want the routes to keep accepting
messages during shutdown of Camel, then
set acceptMessagesWhileStopping=true.
* link:oncompletion.html[OnCompletion] now runs without thread pool by
default. To restore old behavior set `paralllelProcessing` to true. +
* Setting autoStartup to false, and starting a CamelContext the 2nd time
now does not start the routes, instead use the new startAllRoutes method
on CamelContext to start all the routes.
* link:bean.html[Bean] component caches the bean by default (eg a single
instance of the bean is reused). This can be turned off by setting
cache=false, which now enforces a new instance of the bean is created
and used once (no reuse, aka prototype scoped) +

[[Camel2.14.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Java 1.6 no longer supported.
* Unit testing with Spring 3.x now requires using camel-test-spring3, as
camel-test-spring is for Spring 4.0.x. Support for testing with Spring
4.1 coming in Camel 2.15 onwards.
* Support for Jetty 7.x is deprecated and dropped in next release. +
