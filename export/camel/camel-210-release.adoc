[[Camel2.1.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.1.0 release which approx 303 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Pluggable API for Management allowing 3rd party to manage Camel.
** Use `org.apache.camel.spi.ManagementStrategy` to plugin 3rd party
adapter
** Fine grained events notifications is now being emitted using
`org.apache.camel.spi.EventNotifier`
** Events being fired can be created using a pluggable factory using
`org.apache.camel.spi.EventFactory`
** Camel now supports using multiple
`org.apache.camel.spi.LifecycleStrategy` strategies, that also allows
3rd party to more easily integrate into Camel.
* Overhaul of default link:camel-jmx.html[JMX management] in Camel to be
much improved with more attributes, mbeans, operations, statistics, and
route timing working as well.
** And yes you can now start/stop routes and individual consumers and
producers
** And some special processors such as link:delayer.html[Delayer] and
link:throttler.html[Throttler] can be managed to change their
delay/throttle values
** You can dynamic manage link:tracer.html[tracing] even for already
running applications
** link:error-handling-in-camel.html[Error handling in Camel] is now
also manageable so you for example can change the redelivery policies.
** link:jms.html[JMS] consumers being restarted will pickup any
configuration changes on JMS endpoints such as changing
`concurrentConsumers`. And yes its fully managed using JMX.
** Number of inflight exchanges per consumer, route and totally per
camel context.
** And much more...
* Improved link:irc.html[IRC], link:xmpp.html[XMPP],
link:mina.html[MINA], link:cxf.html[CXF] and
link:freemarker.html[FreeMarker] components with much thanks to the
Camel community
* Added classLoader set and get method in the CamelContext to make Camel
work better in the Container.
* Introduced camel-spring-osgi bundle which is merged from camel-spring
and camel-osgi bundle to avoid the issue of installing upper bundles in
a wrong order.
* Now Camel Karaf features are validated with the Karaf plugin.
* link:cxf.html[camel-cxf] beans component supports JAXWS beans.
* camel-cxf MTOM attachment supports in Payload mode.
* Fixed the Null message will cause camel converter stop working issue.
* camel-cxf endpoint no longer requires the "serviceClass" option or
Service Endpoint Interface (SEI) in Payload mode.Â  It means only WSDL is
needed but the intended port and service name in the WSDL must be
provided for the camel-cxf endpoint.
* link:velocity.html[Velocity] component supports to take the Velocity
configuration by using propertiesFile option.
* link:splitter.html[Splitter] and link:multicast.html[Multicast] EIP
patterns now support the option `stopOnException` to stop continue
processing at first exception occurred. See their documentation for more
details.
* link:error-handling-in-camel.html[Error handlers] is restricted to be
configured on camel context and/or routes only.
* Camel is now more robust and fault tolerant when shutting down.
* Fixed a race condition when shutting down Camel with
link:jms.html[JMS] consumers that under some circumstances caused it to
appear to hang
* Added pluggable `org.apache.camel.spi.InflightRepository` with a basic
implementation that can help with graceful shutdown as you can now see
how many exchanges are currently in progress.
* link:jms.html[JmsEndpoint] is now singleton
* Individual routes can be
link:configuring-route-startup-ordering-and-autostartup.html[pre
configured to not auto startup] when Camel starts: `autoStartup=false`
in XML DSL and `noAutoStartup()` in Java DSL.
* Camel is more robust on startup as route inputs are deferred to be
started at the very end, ensuring all routes services have been pre
started and thus ready when consumers is started.
* Improved unit test coverage, now having more than 4200 unit tests in
total.
* Fixed `ConsumerTemplate` not working when it was dependency injected
with `@EndpointInjected` in a link:bean.html[Bean].
* Using IBM special JMS headers now work when sending messages to IBM
WebSphere MQ. IBM special headers uses this prefix: `JMS_IBM_`. In fact
it works with any `JMS_<vendor>_` header.
* The
link:configuring-route-startup-ordering-and-autostartup.html[ordering of
which routes should be started] can now be configured by the
`startupOrder` attribute which defines a number. Lowest number is
started first.
* And `autoStartup` is also supported on
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] itself where it replaces the
`shouldStartContext` option, which have been removed.
* Camel now checks on startup if multiple routes uses the *same*
endpoint as inputs, if so it fails to start. This prevents starting
Camel if you have routes with e.g. copy/paste typos. Only
link:jms.html[JMS] and link:mina.html[MINA] support multiple routes to
consume from *same* endpoint. The `MultipeConsumersSupport` interface
can be optionally implemented by the endpoint to control this behavior.
* The link:file2.html[File] component handles renaming and deleting
files on Windows better as Windows could block files. Also Antivirus
software could causes files to be blocked.
* Fixed issues using `tempPrefix` option with the link:file2.html[File]
in case of clashes with existing files. The same goes for the
`localWorkDirectory` option on the link:ftp2.html[FTP] component which
could have a similar issue.
* Optimized link:xpath.html[XPath] to allow thread safe concurrency
which greatly reduces contention.
* Camel works better with Google App Engine
* The link:bean.html[Bean] component is better at choosing the best
method. If given a method name it will only pick among methods with such
a name.
* The link:bean.html[Bean] component is now also more strict as it
*must* be able to convert to all the parameter types. Was to lenient
before by passing in `null` instead, when conversion was not successful.
* The link:bean.html[Bean] component now works with Spring
@Transactional annotations where it uses CGLIB enhanced classes.
* Fixed an issue with setting global error handling in Spring XML not
always working
* Camel link:dead-letter-channel.html[adds properties] to
link:exchange.html[Exchange] when sending to endpoints. This is useable
with link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] where we can use
this to know which link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] failed.
* Improved file operations on Windows platform to retry in case of
issues.
* Fixed issue with `replyTo` option on link:jms.html[JMS] consumers
which wasn't working.
* Fixed issue with using <camel:proxy> not working
* Improved `<camel:proxy>` so its easier to work with out of the box. It
leverages Camels type converter mechanism to adapt to the interface.
Also proxied methods with a single parameter turns that parameter value
into the message body.
* Added document for using link:using-camelproxy.html[Camel proxy].
* Improved `enrich` and `pollEnrich` with reference lookup of endpoints
and aggregation strategy.
* Added `markRollbackOnly` attribute on `<rollback>` to only mark the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] for rollback. This allows you to set a
custom reply message. Previously a `RollbackExchangeException` was
always set which causes Camel to thrown an exception to the client. This
also works with `transacted` routes as well.
* Camel now logs on shutdown whether there was in flight exchanges or
not. All together we are getting closer to having graceful shutdown
supported in Camel.
* `@Bean` is now easier to use at you define `ref` and `method` instead
of one combined value.
* Introduced `routeId` in the Java DSL to set the id of the route.
Prefer to use this over `id`.
* Introduced link:routepolicy.html[RoutePolicy] allowing to automatic
and dynamically controlling routes at runtime.
* Supplied `ThrottlingRoutePolicy` out of the box for dynamic throttling
route consumers using metrics based on the current number of inflight
exchanges.
* link:data-format.html[Data Format] is now resolved just as
link:components.html[Components] and link:languages.html[Languages] by
looking for magic file under
`META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/dataformat/`.
* The link:http.html[HTTP] component now also supports using NTLM
authentication
* link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] improved to better select
the best `onException` to use. Now a direct match will *always* be used
in case one existed anywhere in the caused exception hierarchy. This
avoid Camel eagerly selecting a too generic such as
`onException(Exception.class)` when a direct match existed.
* link:ftp2.html[FTP] can now have its `FTPClient` and `FTPClientConfig`
configured using URI parameters. Can for example be used to set a
timeout on the `FTPClient`.
* link:ftp2.html[FTP] is now more robust when writing files where it
will reconnect the connect in case of problems.
* Added support in camel-core for non blocking
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] using link:toasync.html[ToAsync].
* link:jetty.html[Jetty] HTTP producer supports non blocking
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply]. See more at
link:toasync.html[ToAsync] and the link:http-async-example.html[HTTP
Async Example].
* `HttpOperationFailedException` now uses pure Java types so it can
safely be transported over network without being dependent on 3rd part
.jars.
* Improvements to link:tracer.html[Tracer] to let it be more fine
grained when used with link:aggregator.html[Aggregator],
link:splitter.html[Splitter] etc. who has sub routes. It now also
outputs correct doTry .. doCatch .. doFinally and onException etc.
* Added `adviceWith(RouteBuilder)` to `RouteDefinition` which allows you
to advice any existing route with a route builder where you can define
interceptors etc. This is useable for testing so you can write tests
based on existing routes and advice them with interceptors so you can
detour messages and simulate errors etc.
* link:timer.html[Timer] and link:quartz.html[Quartz] now logs Exchanges
that failed with an exception at ERROR level to help identify the
problem.
* link:tutorial-for-camel-on-google-app-engine.html[Google App Engine
supported] excellent work by our new committer Martin Krasser.
* Improved link:cxf.html[CXF] producer in `POJO` mode to use the POJO
body without having to wrap it in a `java.util.List` which allows for
easier usage. See for example the link:cxf-async-example.html[CXF Async
Example].
* Added option `testConnectionOnStartup` to link:jms.html[JMS] to test
connection on startup. The goal is to ensures that when Camel is started
all the JMS consumers have a valid connection to the JMS broker. However
if a connection cannot be established then Camel throws an exception on
startup.
* link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] is validating its
`deadLetterUri` on startup to prevent failing at runtime.
* Failing to create routes is now reported with a more precise error
message which pinpoints which route and what part of the route is
causing the problem.
* Fixed issue with transacted routes mixed with Camel error handling
doing redelivery from the beginning of the route and not only at the
failed node in the route path.
* Fixed issue with using link:bam.html[BAM] with Hibernate.
* Options to the `java.sql.Statement` can be set from the URI in the
link:jdbc.html[JDBC] component. Can be used to set maxRows etc.
* Added documentation for link:nmr.html[NMR] and
link:quickfix.html[Quickfix].
* Fixed issues with link:mail.html[Mail] and having multiple endpoints
defined with different recipients could cause Camel to use the
recipients from the last defined endpoint only.
* Improved link:mail.html[Mail] to better recover from network failure
on subsequent polls
* Improved link:tracer.html[Tracer] to output route id
* Fixed a potential 2gb file copy limit using NIO when doing
from("file:xxx").XXXX.to("file:yyy") routing.
* Upgraded and fixed link:el.html[EL] to work with OSGi containers.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-APIbreaking]]
API breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[Camel2.1.0Release-DSLchanges]]
DSL changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Java DSL the `.errorHandler` is now restricted to be configured
on camel context and/or routes only. That means for configuring on
routes you have to set it directly after the `.from` DSL.

In Spring DSL the `errorHandlerRef` attribute is now only visible on the
`<camelContext>` and `<route>` XML tags.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-New.jardependencies]]
New .jar dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

camel-core now depends on commons-management.jar to facilitate the new
overhauled management. +
This project is hosted at http://commonman.fusesource.org/[FuseForge]

This .jar can be retrieved from the maven central repo at:
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/fusesource/commonman/commons-management/1.0/ +
The maven dependency details are:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
 <groupId>org.fusesource.commonman</groupId>
 <artifactId>commons-management</artifactId>
 <version>1.0</version>
----

[[Camel2.1.0Release-DataFormatresolution]]
DataFormat resolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data formats is now resolved just as components and languages etc.
making it consistent. If you have your own custom data formats you need
to create the magic file under
`META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/dataformat` which is a file with the
data format name. See for example `camel-jackson` for an example how to
do that.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-camel-http]]
camel-http
^^^^^^^^^^

`HttpOperationFailedException` has been changed.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-CoreAPI]]
Core API
^^^^^^^^

[[Camel2.1.0Release-CamelContext]]
CamelContext
++++++++++++

CamelContext have renamed the method `getLifecycleStrategy` to
`getLifecycleStrategies` and now returns a List.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-Exchange]]
Exchange
++++++++

The exchange id has been changed to use the `java.util.UUID` instead.
This allows Camel to run on Google App Engine.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-Management]]
Management
++++++++++

The API in `org.apache.camel.spi.ManagementNamingStrategy` had its
methods renaming and method signature adjusted to accommodate the big
theme for Camel which was overhaul of management (JMX).

[[Camel2.1.0Release-SPI]]
SPI
+++

The `TraceableUnitOfWork` has been renamed to `TracedRouteNote` which is
accessible from `UnitOfWork`.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-DeadLetterChannel]]
DeadLetterChannel
+++++++++++++++++

The `deadLetterUri` uri now only accepts a single endpoint which is
prechecked on startup. You cannot any longer using multiple endpoints
separated by comma. That was in fact an internal hidden feature because
a recipient list was used beforehand to produce to the dead letter
queue. Adding the precheck removed the recipient list. You can use
link:direct.html[Direct] and route to a route which can then use a
recipient list in case you really need this.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-ClientAPI]]
Client API
^^^^^^^^^^

[[Camel2.1.0Release-Removedclasses]]
Removed classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `org.apache.camel.processor.CompositeProcessor` was never used
* `org.apache.camel.impl.ProducerTemplateProcessor` was never used
* `org.apache.camel.impl.NoPolicy` was never used
* `org.apache.camel.spring.handler.LazyLoadingBeanDefinitionParser` was
never used
* `org.apache.camel.spring.handler.ScriptDefinitionParser` was never
used
* `org.apache.camel.spring.remoting.SendBeforeInterceptor` was never
used
* `org.apache.camel.spring.spi.SpringConverters` was never used

[[Camel2.1.0Release-Movedclasses]]
Moved classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollStrategy` is moved to
`org.apache.camel.spi.PollingConsumerPollStrategy`
* `org.apache.camel.impl.scan.PatternBasedPackageScanFilter` is moved to
`org.apache.camel.spring.PatternBasedPackageScanFilter` in the
*camel-spring* jar.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-Removedmethods]]
Removed methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `getSingletonEndpoints` method have been removed from various classes
in the `camel-test` component.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-RemovedinSpringXML]]
Removed in Spring XML
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The option `shouldStartContext` on <camelContext> have been removed. Its
replaced with `autoStartup` which you can read more about here
link:configuring-route-startup-ordering-and-autostartup.html[Configuring
route startup ordering and autostartup].

[[Camel2.1.0Release-@Bean]]
@Bean
^^^^^

@Bean now uses a `ref` attribute to refer to the bean name. Also added a
new `method` attribute to set the method to use (optional). +
You need to upgrade your code to use these attributes as the default
`value` have been removed. We assume only a very few people knew and
uses this @Bean annotation.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-component]]
link:direct.html[Direct] component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The option `allowMultipleConsumers` has been removed as it did not make
sense to have concurrent consumers on a direct endpoint.

[[Camel2.1.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip] EIP does not break when Exchange is
failed, see
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CAMEL&title=CAMEL-2245&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=2852389[CAMEL-2245].

Using <transacted/> in Spring XML does not work properly when using
route scoped <onException> and/or <onCompletion>. Using context scoped
works. And the Java DSL does not have this flaw. See
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CAMEL&title=CAMEL-2336&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=2852389[CAMEL-2336].

When using the link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] together with
link:mina.html[MINA] endpoints Camel will over time hold on to memory
which could lead to OutOfMemoryErrors. See more at:
https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-2484[CAMEL-2484]

See known issues from previous releases.
