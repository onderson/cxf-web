[[JMX-JMXComponent]]
JMX Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.6*

[[JMX-StandardJMXConsumerConfiguration]]
Standard JMX Consumer Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Component allows consumers to subscribe to an mbean's Notifications. The
component supports passing the Notification object directly through the
Exchange or serializing it to XML according to the schema provided
within this project. This is a consumer only component. Exceptions are
thrown if you attempt to create a producer for it.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

xml <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
<artifactId>camel-jmx</artifactId> <version>x.x.x</version> <!-- use the
same version as your Camel core version --> </dependency>

[[JMX-URIFormat]]
URI Format
++++++++++

The component can connect to the local platform mbean server with the
following URI:

jmx://platform?options

A remote mbean server url can be provided following the initial JMX
scheme like so:

jmx:service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi?options

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
?options=value&option2=value&...

confluenceTableSmall

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Required |Default |Description
|format |  |xml |Format for the message body. Either "xml" or "raw". If
xml, the notification is serialized to xml. If raw, then the raw java
object is set as the body.

|user |  |  |Credentials for making a remote connection.

|password |  |  |Credentials for making a remote connection.

|objectDomain |yes |  |The domain for the mbean you're connecting to.

|objectName |  |  |The name key for the mbean you're connecting to. This
value is mutually exclusive with the object properties that get passed.
(see below)

|notificationFilter |  |  |Reference to a bean that implements the
`NotificationFilter`. The #ref syntax should be used to reference the
bean via the link:registry.html[Registry].

|handback |  |  |Value to handback to the listener when a notification
is received. This value will be put in the message header with the key
"jmx.handback"

|testConnectionOnStartup |  |true |*Camel 2.11* If true, the consumer
will throw an exception when unable to establish the JMX connection upon
startup. If false, the consumer will attempt to establish the JMX
connection every 'x' seconds until the connection is made – where 'x' is
the configured _reconnectDelay_.

|reconnectOnConnectionFailure |  |false |*Camel 2.11* If true, the
consumer will attempt to reconnect to the JMX server when any connection
failure occurs. The consumer will attempt to re-establish the JMX
connection every 'x' seconds until the connection is made-- where 'x' is
the configured _reconnectDelay_.

|reconnectDelay |  |10 seconds |*Camel 2.11* The number of seconds to
wait before retrying creation of the initial connection or before
reconnecting a lost connection.

[[JMX-ObjectNameConstruction]]
ObjectName Construction
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The URI must always have the objectDomain property. In addition, the URI
must contain either objectName or one or more properties that start with
"key."

[[JMX-DomainwithNameproperty]]
Domain with Name property
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

When the objectName property is provided, the following constructor is
used to build the ObjectName? for the mbean:

ObjectName(String domain, String key, String value)

The key value in the above will be "name" and the value will be the
value of the objectName property.

[[JMX-DomainwithHashtable]]
Domain with Hashtable
+++++++++++++++++++++

ObjectName(String domain, Hashtable<String,String> table)

The Hashtable is constructed by extracting properties that start with
"key." The properties will have the "key." prefixed stripped prior to
building the Hashtable. This allows the URI to contain a variable number
of properties to identify the mbean.

[[JMX-MonitorTypeConsumer]]
Monitor Type Consumer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.8* +
One popular use case for JMX is creating a monitor bean to monitor an
attribute on a deployed bean. This requires writing a few lines of Java
code to create the JMX monitor and deploy it. As shown below:

java CounterMonitor monitor = new CounterMonitor();
monitor.addObservedObject(makeObjectName("simpleBean"));
monitor.setObservedAttribute("MonitorNumber"); monitor.setNotify(true);
monitor.setInitThreshold(1); monitor.setGranularityPeriod(500);
registerBean(monitor, makeObjectName("counter")); monitor.start();

The 2.8 version introduces a new type of consumer that automatically
creates and registers a monitor bean for the specified objectName and
attribute. Additional endpoint attributes allow the user to specify the
attribute to monitor, type of monitor to create, and any other required
properties. The code snippet above is condensed into a set of endpoint
properties. The consumer uses these properties to create the
CounterMonitor, register it, and then subscribe to its changes. All of
the JMX monitor types are supported.

[[JMX-Example.1]]
Example
+++++++

java from("jmx:platform?objectDomain=myDomain&objectName=simpleBean&" +
"monitorType=counter&observedAttribute=MonitorNumber&initThreshold=1&" +
"granularityPeriod=500").to("mock:sink");

The example above will cause a new Monitor Bean to be created and
depoyed to the local mbean server that monitors the "MonitorNumber"
attribute on the "simpleBean." Additional types of monitor beans and
options are detailed below. The newly deployed monitor bean is
automatically undeployed when the consumer is stopped.

[[JMX-URIOptionsforMonitorType]]

|property |type |applies to |description
|monitorType |enum |all |one of counter, guage, string

|observedAttribute |string |all |the attribute being observed

|granualityPeriod |long |all |granularity period (in millis) for the
attribute being observed. As per JMX, default is 10 seconds

|initThreshold |number |counter |initial threshold value

|offset |number |counter |offset value

|modulus |number |counter |modulus value

|differenceMode |boolean |counter, gauge |true if difference should be
reported, false for actual value

|notifyHigh |boolean |gauge |high notification on/off switch

|notifyLow |boolean |gauge |low notification on/off switch

|highThreshold |number |gauge |threshold for reporting high notification

|lowThreshold |number |gauge |threshold for reporting low notificaton

|notifyDiffer |boolean |string |true to fire notification when string
differs

|notifyMatch |boolean |string |true to fire notification when string
matches

|stringToCompare |string |string |string to compare against the
attribute value
|=======================================================================

The monitor style consumer is only supported for the local mbean server.
JMX does not currently support remote deployment of mbeans without
either having the classes already remotely deployed or an adapter
library on both the client and server to facilitate a proxy deployment.
