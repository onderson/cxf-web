Cafe Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to use Camel to implement a Cafe use case.

First It uses the splitter to dispatch the order, then sends the orders
to barista by checking if the coffee is hot or cold. When the coffee is
ready, we use a aggregate to gather the drinks for waiter to deliver.

Here is the route builder code for it.
