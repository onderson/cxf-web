[[Camel2.15.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.15.0 release which approx 500 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Component, data format, language and eip documentation now included in
the built component JARs. And Java API and JMX API to access that
documentation. And APIs to explain an endpoint uri, eip configuration
and what all those configured options mean. In other words the same
level of complete documentation of your Camel apps at both design and
runtime, accessible from Java / JMX and tooling.
* Component, data format, language and eip can now
have associated label(s) which are used for grouping components into:
core, database, messaging, http, rest, etc.
* The XML DSL schema now include documentation
* Provide Configurer for user to configure the CXF conduit and CXF
destination from Java code
* Added a `DelegateEndpoint` interface into Camel API
* Support to setup the SslContextParameters in the
link:restlet.html[camel-restlet] component
* Java DSL - Should support nested choice in doTry .. doCatch
* link:mongodb.html[MongoDb] component now
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-7996[stores OIDs] of the
inserted records in the message header
* link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] now supports specifying
custom link:exchange-pattern.html[Exchange Pattern] in the endpoint ur's
* link:type-converter.html[Type Converter] to enum's is now case
insensitive, so you can convert safely level=info to an enum with name
Level.INFO etc.
* link:xslt.html[XSLT]
and https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38909[Validation]
components now provides all their endpoint configurations in the
endpoint, and not only in the component, making these components like
any other components.
* Made the link:karaf.html[Camel Karaf Commands] reusable by moving
common code into a `camel-commands-core` module that SPI can extend and
plugin Camel commands for other environments.
* Further hardening of the link:sjms.html[SJMS] component.
* link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL] with embedded routes now supports
link:exception-clause.html[onException], link:intercept.html[intercept]
etc in use for those embedded routes, just like any regular routes. 
* link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL] now by default uses custom error message
as-is without attempting to binding output (requires a HTTP error code
of 300+ is set as a header)
* Camel link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Using PropertyPlaceholder]
now supports specifying a default value together with the key to lookup.
* Camel link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Using PropertyPlaceholder]
now supports not having to define a PropertiesComponent if all the
placeholder keys has default values which are to be used (less
configuration needed in those situations).
* Camel link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Using PropertyPlaceholder]
now supports 3rd party functions to lookup the property values, this
allow end users to implement their own logic - we provide 3 out of the
box functions to lookup values from OS environment variable, JVM system
properties, or the service name idiom.
* link:rabbitmq.html[RabbitMQ] now pools Channels for the producer to
avoid sharing same Channel among concurrent producers which are not
recommended by RabbitMQ client.
* Camel commands is now reusable outside Apache Karaf as a base by
the `commands-core` module.
* Camel commands using http://www.jolokia.org/[Jolokia] for remote
communication by the `commands-jolokia` module.
* More minor processors such as setHeader, removeHeader, removeHeaders
and ditto for properties is now also enlisted in JMX under processors.
* Optimized usage of type conversion during routing reducing the number
of attempts needed.
* Optimized CaseInsentiveMap used as message headers to use a single map
instead of two and yield less memory overhead and performance
* Asynchronous routing engine that are forced to block threads now
exposes this using a link:asyncprocessorawaitmanager.html[manager] that
offers runtime insight using JMX. And as well attempts to free blocked
threads during graceful shutdown, to avoid any threads hanging in the
JVM.
* link:swagger.html[Swagger] now supports any kind of runtime
environment, as only JMX being enabled is required.
* link:xml-security-component.html[XML Security component] supports
now  XAdES-BES/EPES in the signer endpoint.
* link:hl7.html[HL7] MLLP codec now supports link:netty4.html[Netty4]
based transport.
* Inflight repository now allows to browse the current inflight
exchanges to obtain information where these exchanges are inflight and
for how long. Expose this information in JMX and Camel commands as well.
* link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful Shutdown] now logs information
about the inflight exchanges that are still present during shutdown and
a timeout was hit.
* link:message-history.html[Message History] which dumps Exchange
information not supports
the link:how-do-i-set-the-max-chars-when-debug-logging-messages-in-camel.html[Exchange.LOG_DEBUG_BODY_MAX_CHARS]
option to limit the max chars outputted in the logs.
* `DefaultClassLoader` now fallback and use the application context
classloader that may have been set on `CamelContext` to better be able
to load classes/resources from classpath in different runtime
environments. +
* link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] now includes current inflight exchanges
at processor level, which means we can have a complete breakdown where
exchanges are, and as well from the improved `InflightRegistry` which
has APi and JMX api to browse the current inflight with details of the
exchange and processing times etc.
* Support for Jetty 9 using the new `camel-component-jetty9` module.
* The `EndpointRegistry` now stores endpoints in two caches; a static
unbounded cache to keep endpoints for their lifetime, and a dynamic
limited cache to keep only the recently used endpoints. 
* link:endpoint.html[Endpoint]'s used by routes are kept in the static
cache of the `EndpointRegistry` as long as the lifetime of the routes.
* Removing a route now also remove its
static link:endpoint.html[Endpoint]'s from the `EndpointRegistry` (if
those endpoints are not shared and used by other routes). Mind that any
dynamic endpoint created during routing from dynamic link:eip.html[EIP]s
such as recipient list, routing slip, dynamic router etc, are not
removed from the `EndpointRegistry` when the route is removed.
* link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] now logs a WARN if
a new exception occurred while it was attempting to process the dead
letter message. The new exception will by default be handled so
the link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] always complete
succesfull. The new option deadLetterHandleNewException can be set
to `false` to turn this off.
* link:groovy.html[GroovyShell] creation process can now be
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8259[customized] using
`GroovyShellFactory` SPI interface.
* link:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.html[Configuring endpoint uris in
XML DSL] now allow to specify the uri attribute using multiple lines;
this can make it more readable when having very long uris. Notice only
the uri attributes support this.
* link:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.html[Configuring endpoint uris in
XML DSL] now allow to specify endpoint options using <property>  bean
style in the <endpoint> configuration;  this can make it more readable
when having very long uris. 
* Using custom Jackson modules is easier with the
Jackson link:json.html[JSON] data format.
* Enabling and disabling features using link:json.html[Jackson] data
format is easier from both Java and XML DSL.
* Some HTTP producer now allows GET operations with message body (though
a bit unusual to do)
* Aggregate EIP now supports letting the `AggregationStrategy` determine
if the current group is complete by returning a boolean property on the
returned exchange.
* camel-cdi supports CDI 1.0 onwards now.

[[Camel2.15.0Release-Fixedissues]]
Fixed issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed processors was not enlisted in JMX when routes was transacted.
* Fixed the NullPointerException when using CXF endpoint with enrich
* Fixed the endpointProperty of restConfiguration doesn't work issue
* Fixed the issue that CircuitBreakerLoadBalancer fails on async
processors
* Fixed MyBatis consumer
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8011[ignoring
maxMessagesPerPoll] option
* Fixed potential issue with pollEnrich not triggering error handler if
an exception was thrown in the polling.
* Fixed a memory leak if using link:dynamic-router.html[Dynamic Router]
that loops many times, and uses any of `convertBodyTo` or `setBody`
or `transform` in the loop, causing memory to stack up until the
Exchange is done.
* Fixed and improved how link:bean.html[Bean] component
and link:simple.html[Simple] language invoking beans detect methods that
are overridden, and able to filter and apply this as a single method, to
be invoked. Avoids AmbiguousMethodCallException being thrown.
* Fixed a thread leak if restarting routes using stop/start and the
routes is a scheduled poll consumer, such as file/ftp components.
* Using ?exchangePattern=InOnly or InOut in endpoint uris now take
precedence as the pattern in use when sending to the endpoint, using
to/recipient list.
* link:mail.html[Mail] component no longer includes headers starting
with `Camel` in their keys, as those are consider internal headers and
should not be included in the sent emails.
* Fixed readLock=fileLock on the file component
* Fixed link:stomp.html[Stomp] not detecting failure when sending, but
was assuming a send always succeeded
* Fixed link:mqtt.html[MQTT] sending to broker being more resilient and
automatic ensure re-connection when connection failures
* Fixed sending to FTP may cause the producer to hang in an endless
reconnection attempt if the socket connection is dead. (Use
soTimeout=10000 or some positive value to potential mitigate this in
older releases).
* link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] and link:multicast.html[Multicast] (in
parallel mode) EIPs now copies the message body if its
link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] based - this allows concurrent
threads to work individually using their own copy of the stream, to have
reliable access to the body. +

[[Camel2.15.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The camel-cxf feature doesn't install the required camel-spring feature
by default. Therefore, you have to install it separately before:
'features:install camel-spring'

The camel-swagger feature doesn't install the required scala-reflect
bundle by default. Therefore, you have to install it separately before:
'install -s mvn:org.scala-lang/scala-reflect/2.10.4'

[[Camel2.15.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Spring 4.1.x is now the default out of the box Spring version.
* Unit testing with Spring 4.0.x requires using camel-test-spring40, as
camel-test-spring is for Spring 4.1 or better.
* Remember to
add `@BootstrapWith``(CamelTestContextBootstrapper.``class``)` if
upgrading from Spring 3.x or 4.0.x to Spring 4.1 onwards, and using the
camel-test-spring module.
* link:xslt.html[XSLT] component now require
configuring `transformerFactory` using link:uris.html[URIs] with the
#syntax to refer to a bean. Just like any other component would do.
* Slight refactor in `camel-metrics` component which may affect users
who are using the java endpoint types instead of configuring using uris
* `camel-csv` upgraded to Commons CSV 1.x which has a different API than
the old 0.x version. End users may need to adjust their code.
* `camel-sjms` has been refactored a bit to further harden this
component. End users may need to adjust their code.
* The link:simple.html[simple] function properties:locations:key has
been renamed to properties-location:locations:key, as it would clash
with the new functionality to specify a default value after the key
name, eg properties:key:default
* Removed the backlog tracer commands from the Karaf Camel commands as
they are not suitable for a CLI environment
* The need for runtime specific servlets in
link:swagger.html[Swagger] has been removed, and instead just use the
default servlet which is provided out of the box. 
* `org.apache.camel.spi.InflightRepository` now includes additional
methods for browsing in-flight exchanges.
* Using ?exchangePattern=InOnly or InOut in endpoint uris now take
precedence as the pattern in use when sending to the endpoint, using
to/recipient list.
* `DefaultClassLoader` now fallback and use the application context
classloader that may have been set on `CamelContext` to better be able
to load classes/resources from classpath in different runtime
environments.
* link:mail.html[Mail] component no longer includes headers starting
with `Camel` in their keys, as those are consider internal headers and
should not be included in the sent emails.
* Removing a route now also remove its
static link:endpoint.html[Endpoint]'s from the `EndpointRegistry` (if
those endpoints are not shared and used by other routes). Mind that any
dynamic endpoint created during routing from dynamic link:eip.html[EIP]s
such as recipient list, routing slip, dynamic router etc, are not
removed from the `EndpointRegistry` when the route is removed.
* All boolean isFoo methods on the model classes has been removed to
ensure the model has consistent java bean getter/setter style with
exactly one getter and one setter of the same type.
* The exchange property language has been renamed from property to
exchangeProperty to avoid ambiguity, confusion and clash with properties
as a general term. So use exchangeProperty instead of property.
* The delay option in link:snmp.html[SNMP] has changed from using
seconds to millis as time unit.
* Routing starting from a link:bean.html[Bean] endpoint is not supported
(which wasnt really intended anyway), instead start with a scheduler and
use to bean instead.
* Added `copy` method to `StreamCache` api
for link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching]
* The `camel-jetty` component is now split into `camel-jetty8`
and `camel-jetty9` to support both Jetty versions. But only one is
supported on the the classpath so pick only one of them.
* Custom components using `@UriEndpoint` must now include a syntax
attribute to document the uri syntax of the endpoint, when using the apt
compiler plugin to generate documentation.
* Scala users should favor using ScalaRouteBuilder instance of
RouteBuilder. +
