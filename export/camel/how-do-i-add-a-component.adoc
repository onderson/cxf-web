How do I add a component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might first want to read link:writing-components.html[Writing
Components] for a background in how to implement a new component. +
Typically it means you write an implementation of the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Component.html[Component]
interface, usually deriving from
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/impl/DefaultComponent.html[DefaultComponent].

You can then register your component explicitly via

CamelContext context = new DefaultCamelContext();
context.addComponent("foo", new FooComponent(context));

However you can use the auto-discovery feature of Camel where by Camel
will automatically add a link:component.html[Component] when an endpoint
URI is used. To do this you would create a file called

/META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component/foo

with contents

class=org.acme.FooComponent

(you can add other property configurations in there too if you like)

Then if you refer to an endpoint as *`foo://somethingOrOther`* Camel
will auto-discover your component and register it.

The *`FooComponent`* can then be auto-injected with resources using the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/spi/Injector.html[Injector],
such as to support link:spring.html[Spring] based auto-wiring, or to
support *`@Resource`* (EJB3 style) injection or Guice style *`@Inject`*
injection.

Working with Spring XML
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can configure a component via Spring using the following
mechanism...\{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-jms/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/jms/jmsRouteUsingSpring.xml}Which
allows you to configure a component using some name (activemq in the
above example), then you can refer to the component using
*`activemq:[queue:|topic:]destinationName`*.

If you want to add explicit Spring 2.x XML objects to your XML then you
could use the *`xbean-spring`* which tries to automate most of the XML
binding work for you; or you could look in camel-spring
at *`CamelNamespaceHandler`* you'll see how we handle the Spring XML
stuff (warning its kinda hairy code to look at

If you wanted *`<fooComponent>`* to be a standard part of the core Camel
schema then you'd hack that file to add your component &
link:contributing.html[conftribute a patch] to the camel XSD. Otherwise
you could write your own namespace & schema if you prefer.
