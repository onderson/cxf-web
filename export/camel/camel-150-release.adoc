[[Camel1.5.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 1.5.0 release which approx 266 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* support for link:guice.html[Guice] for dependency injection along with
a new link:guice-jms-example.html[Guice JMS Example]
* major improvements in link:ftp2.html[FTP] and link:file2.html[File]
components
* link:file2.html[File] consumers now default uses exclusive read
locking when it consume files, meaning that they wont consume files that
are in the progress of being written by third part. The FTP consumer has
this support as well, however it is disabled by default as it requires
write privileges.
* link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] component supports
expression to set dynamic filename patterns instead of using the
`FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME` header. See
link:file-language.html[File Language] for samples and use cases.
* important changes in ProducerTemplate (see below)
* link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] now supports marking
exceptions as being *handled* so callers doesn't receive the caused
exception, but you can set the response to return instead. This is a
very important feature.
* various improvements in link:flatpack.html[Flatpack] and
link:xmpp.html[XMPP] components
* minor improvements in link:cxf.html[CXF],
link:springintegration.html[SpringIntegration], link:http.html[HTTP],
link:mail.html[Mail] and link:mina.html[Mina] components
* minor improvements in link:aggregator.html[Aggregator] supporting a
better fluent builder, etc.
* link:splitter.html[splitter] now handles streaming avoiding reading
entire content into memory (consuming very big 1gb files is now
possible)
* introduced new link:jt400.html[jt400], link:hl7.html[HL7],
link:ldap.html[LDAP] and link:smooks.html[Smooks] components
* introduced link:delay-interceptor.html[Delay Interceptor] to slow down
processing to show how things is happening nice and slow, so you are not
bombarded with zillions of logging output.
* link:mail.html[Mail] can now send html mails with the new
`contentType` option
* link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel Maven Archetypes] now available
in http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org[m2eclipse]
http://docs.codehaus.org/display/M2ECLIPSE/Creating+Maven+projects[Maven
project creation]
* link:how-do-i-run-camel-using-java-webstart.html[Java WebStart
support]
* refinements in loading resources using OSGi bundles, should now handle
different OSGi platforms much better
* link:type-converter.html[Type Converter] now supports Exchange as 2nd
parameter to allow converters access to the Exchange and thus the
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] as well. To be used for setting
encoding in the future.
* New link:loop.html[Loop] api in link:dsl.html[DSL] allows processing
of a message a number of times, possibly in different ways.
* Spring DSL improve
* improved link:tracer.html[Tracer] formatting and more options for
configuration
* improved support for all link:endpoint.html[Endpoint]s, not just
singletons in link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext].
* minor tweaks to the link:visualisation.html[Visualisation] generator
* IBM JDK support (link:does-camel-work-on-ibms-jdk.html[notable
exceptions])

[[Camel1.5.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[Camel1.5.0Release-ProducerTemplate]]
ProducerTemplate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/ProducerTemplate.html[ProducerTemplate]
has refined its sendBody and requestBody methods to throw
`RuntimeCamelException`, with the caused exception wrapper, in case the
Exchange failed with an exception. Also if the exchange has set an
`FAULT` message then the `FAULT` message is returned.

The old behavior in Camel 1.4 or older was just plain wrong!

[[Camel1.5.0Release-JMX]]
JMX
^^^

Option usePlatformMBeanServer has changed its default value from *false*
to *true*. +
The naming convention for the JMX
`ObjectName}}s has changed.  Camel now uses simpler, shorter {{ObjectName`(s).

[[Camel1.5.0Release-TypeConverter]]
TypeConverter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An implementation of
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/TypeConverter.html[TypeConverter]
should now throw a
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/NoTypeConversionAvailableException.html[NoTypeConversionAvailableException]
if conversion is not possible. The semantical ambiguity of null (both
valid result and indication of no conversion) is now resolved, but this
may impact existing code in that it should now catch the exception
instead of checking for null.

[[Camel1.5.0Release-setHeaderelementinSpringDSLchanged]]
setHeader element in Spring DSL changed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can no longer use a 'value' attribute like this to set a header to a
constant:

[source,brush:,xml;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
  <from uri="seda:a"/>
  <setHeader headerName="theHeader" value="the value">
    <expression/>        
  </setHeader>
  <to uri="mock:b"/>     
</route>
----

Now, you can use a link:constant.html[Constant] expression to do the
same thing:

[source,brush:,xml;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
  <from uri="seda:a"/>
  <setHeader headerName="theHeader">
    <constant>the value</constant>        
  </setHeader>
  <to uri="mock:b"/>     
</route>
----

Notice that this constant expression is also possible in the Java DSL:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
.setHeader("theHeader", constant("the value"))
----

[[Camel1.5.0Release-redeliveryPolicyspecificationinSpringDSLchanged]]
redeliveryPolicy specification in Spring DSL changed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<redeliveryPolicy>
  <maximumRedeliveries>1</maximumRedeliveries>
  ...
</redeliveryPolicy>
----

You now set redelivery policy settings with attributes

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<redeliveryPolicy maximumRedeliveries="1" .../>
----

[[Camel1.5.0Release-DataformatspecificationinSpringDSLchanged]]
Data format specification in Spring DSL changed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The way you specify data formats in the Spring DSL has changed. You
could do this in Camel 1.4:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
  <jaxb id="myJaxb" prettyPrint="true" contextPath="org.apache.camel.example"/>
  <xstream id="xs" prettyPrint="true"/>

  <route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <marshal ref="myJaxb"/>
    <to uri="direct:marshalled"/>
  </route>
  ...
----

Now, you specify the same as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
  <dataFormats>
    <jaxb id="myJaxb" prettyPrint="true" contextPath="org.apache.camel.example"/>
    <xstream id="xs" prettyPrint="true"/>
  </dataFormats>

  <route>
    <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <marshal ref="myJaxb"/>
    <to uri="direct:marshalled"/>
  </route>
  ...
----

[[Camel1.5.0Release-CXFProducer]]
CXF Producer
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The result of CXF producer has changed to use MessageContentsList
instead of Object array to hold the response. +
If you use the exchange.getOut.getBody(YourType.class), CXFMessage will
check the list members and chose the most right answer for you.

CXF Producer before Camel 1.5

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
     Object[] oldResult = (Object[])oldExchange.getOut().getBody();
     BankQuote oldQuote = (BankQuote) oldResult[0];
----

CXF Produer in Camel 1.5

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
     BankQuote oldQuote = oldExchange.getOut().getBody(BankQuote.class);
----

Now the CXF Producer(in Camel 1.5) will throw the exception after the
CXF client gets the exception, in this way you can leverage the Camel
link:error-handler.html[errorHandler] for handling the exception. +
If you don't want camel redeliver the message when your producer got the
common SOAP fault, specially you are using CXF producer and CXF consumer
as a proxy, you'd better override the Camel default
link:error-handler.html[errorHandler].

You can do it with DSL

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
     protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() {
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            public void configure() {
                errorHandler(noErrorHandler());
                from(routerEndpointURI).to("log:org.apache.camel?level=DEBUG").to(serviceEndpointURI);
            }
        };
    }
----

Or Spring

[source,brush:,xml;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
   <cxf:cxfEndpoint id="routerEndpoint" address="http://localhost:9003/CamelContext/RouterPort"
            serviceClass="org.apache.hello_world_soap_http.GreeterImpl"/>

   <cxf:cxfEndpoint id="serviceEndpoint" address="http://localhost:9000/SoapContext/SoapPort"
            wsdlURL="testutils/hello_world.wsdl"
            serviceClass="org.apache.hello_world_soap_http.Greeter"
            endpointName="s:SoapPort"
            serviceName="s:SOAPService"
        xmlns:s="http://apache.org/hello_world_soap_http" />

   <camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
    <route errorHandlerRef="noErrorHandler">
      <from uri="cxf:bean:routerEndpoint" />
      <to uri="cxf:bean:serviceEndpoint" />
    </route>
   </camelContext>

   <bean id="noErrorHandler" class="org.apache.camel.builder.NoErrorHandlerBuilder"/>
----

[[Camel1.5.0Release-FTPcomponent]]
FTP component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The option `consumer.recursive` has changed the default value from
*true* to *false*.

Now throws `FtpOperationFailedException` with the FTP error code and
reason. For instance error code 530 is not authorized. This applies for
both consumer and producer. The consumer will now also regard failing
move or rename operations as a severe error throw a
`FtpOperationFailedException` instead of `WARN` logging. As a consumer
you will *not* receive an Exchange, as opposed to the situation in Camel
1.4.0. Bottom line: all the FTP operations should succeed before the
consumer will process the Exchange.

[[Camel1.5.0Release-FileConsumer]]
File Consumer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The option `consumer.recursive` has changed the default value from
*true* to *false*.

[[Camel1.5.0Release-HttpProducer]]
Http Producer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now the http producer will throw a `HttpOperationFailedException` if the
response code is not 1xx or 2xx. You can get the status code, status
line and location for the exception. +
In the Camel < 1.5.0 , http producer does not check the response code
and puts the response message into the out message.

Http producer has better algorithm to compute if either GET or POST
should be used.

[[Camel1.5.0Release-camel-mina]]
camel-mina
^^^^^^^^^^

In Camel 1.5 the sync option has changed its default value from *false*
to *true*, as we felt it was confusing for end-users when they used Mina
to call remote servers and Camel wouldn't wait for the response. To
remedy this you had to add the sync=true option before it worked, we
want this to work out-of-the-box without having to specify this option.

[[Camel1.5.0Release-camel-mail]]
camel-mail
^^^^^^^^^^

In Camel 1.5 the following default options has changed in camel-mail:

* `deleteProcessedMessages` is now *false* as we felt Camel should not
delete mails on the mail server by default.
* `processOnlyUnseenMessages` is now *true* as we felt Camel should only
poll new mails by default.

[[Camel1.5.0Release-removeOutHeaderDSLmethodremoved]]
removeOutHeader DSL method removed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since any exchange coming into the removeOutHeader processor would have
an IN message only, this method was useless and so was removed.

[[Camel1.5.0Release-andAggregationCollection]]
link:aggregator.html[Aggregator] and `AggregationCollection`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The AggregationCollection used by link:aggregator.html[Aggregator] is
changed to an interface instead of a class. This allows end-users to
provide their own collections that isn't a subclass of the default. The
old AggregationCollection class is renamed to
DefaultAggregationCollection.

Aggregator must be configured directly on the consumer:

* This is valid: `from("foo").aggregate("bar")`
* This is *not* valid: `from("foo").setHeader("id").aggreagate("bar")` +
See known issues.

[[Camel1.5.0Release-component]]
link:spring-event.html[Spring Event] component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `event` name (scheme) has been renamed to `spring-event`
