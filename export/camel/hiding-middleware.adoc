When writing software these days, its important to try and decouple as
much middleware code from your business logic as possible.

This provides a number of benefits...

* you can choose the right middleware solution for your deployment and
switch at any time
* you don't have to spend a large amount of time learning the specifics
of any particular technology, whether its link:jms.html[JMS] or
link:javaspace.html[JavaSpace] or link:hibernate.html[Hibernate] or
link:jpa.html[JPA] or link:ibatis.html[iBatis] whatever

For example if you want to implement some kind of message passing,
remoting, reliable load balancing or asynchronous processing in your
application we recommend you use Camel annotations to bind your services
and business logic to Camel link:components.html[Components] which means
you can then easily switch between things like

* in JVM messaging with link:seda.html[SEDA]
* using JMS via link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ] or other link:jms.html[JMS]
providers for reliable load balancing, grid or publish and subscribe
* for low volume, but easier administration since you're probably
already using a database you could use
** link:hibernate.html[Hibernate] or link:jpa.html[JPA] to use an entity
bean / table as a queue
** link:ibatis.html[iBatis] to work with SQL
** link:jdbc.html[JDBC] for raw SQL access
* use link:javaspace.html[JavaSpace]

How to decouple from middleware APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The best approach when using remoting is to use
link:spring-remoting.html[Spring Remoting] which can then use any
messaging or remoting technology under the covers. When using Camel's
implementation you can then use any of the Camel
link:components.html[Components] along with any of the
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns].

Another approach is to bind Java beans to Camel endpoints via the
link:bean-integration.html[Bean Integration]. For example using
link:pojo-consuming.html[POJO Consuming] and
link:pojo-producing.html[POJO Producing] you can avoid using any Camel
APIs to decouple your code both from middleware APIs _and_ Camel APIs!
