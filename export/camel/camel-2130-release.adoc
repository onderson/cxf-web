[[Camel2.13.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.13.0 release which approx 480 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Using <camelContext> in Spring will now shutdown <camelContext> eager
by default. This ensure a cleaner shutdown of Camel, as dependent <bean>
are not shutdown at this moment. The <bean> will then be shutdown after
<camelContext>. There is a new attribute shutdownEager on <camelContext>
to turn this off, and use the old behavior.
* The MBean names registered by link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] no longer
include the hostname in the `context` part, eg before
`context=myHost/myCamelId` and now after `context=myCamelId`. Having the
hostname in the MBean name does not bring much value, and in fact makes
things more complicated as the mbean name changes depending on the host
running Camel.
* link:camel-jmx.html[MBean naming] in OSGi cleaned up to use simpler
naming with symbolicName. Before we could have MBean names with
duplicate bundle ids such as `context=114-114-camel-6`, which now is
using the symbolic name instead, `context=MyApplication`.
* When using multiple OSGi Blueprint <cm:property-placeholder>'s then
Camel now favors using non-default placeholders, or the last
property-placeholder defined in the Blueprint XML file. This allows for
example to define default properties in one placeholder, and override
these values in other placeholders.
* link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumer allow to download a single named file
without using the FTP LIST command. This allows to download a known file
from a FTP server even when the user account does not have permission to
do FTP LIST command.
* link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumer allow to ignore file not found or
insufficient file permission errors.
* link:data-format.html[Data Format] using marshal now leverages
link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] out of the box if enabled,
which allows to marshal big streams and spool to disk, instead of being
pure in-memory based.
* Improved using link:bean.html[Bean] when the bean is looked up in the
link:registry.html[Registry], when using concurrent processing in the
route.
* Added `cache` option to `beanRef` and `<bean>` in the DSL. This avoids
looking up the link:bean.html[Bean] from the
link:registry.html[Registry] on each usage; this can safely be done for
singleton beans.
* Configuring link:data-format.html[Data Format]s in XML attributes now
supports reference lookup using the # syntax, eg
`<jaxb xmlStreamWriterWrapper="#myWriterWrapper" ..>`
* link:jdbc.html[JDBC] component now also support `outputType` to
specify the expected output as either a List or single Object. As well
allow to map to a bean using a `BeanRowMapper` to control the mapping of
ROW names to bean properties.
* Both link:quartz.html[Quartz] as well as link:quartz2.html[Quartz2]
based link:scheduledroutepolicy.html[ScheduledRoutePolicy] has been
improved to better support cluster setups (e.g. to not schedule jobs
being already scheduled through another node inside a given cluster).
* Reduced the work the link:aggregator2.html[Aggregate] EIP does while
holding a lock during aggregation, which can lead to improved
performance in some use-cases.
* `JndiRegistry` now implements all the find methods.
* link:vm.html[VM] component now supports `multipleConsumers=true`
across deployment units.
* Added `@PreConsumed` to link:jpa.html[JPA] consumer.
* Added CamelFileName header support to the link:hdfs.html[HDFS]
producer
* Like as `JpaConsumer` now also `JpaProducer` of the link:jpa.html[JPA]
component supports the `CamelEntityManager` header.
* link:restlet.html[Restlet] consumer now supports returning custom
headers as HTTP headers from the Camel link:message.html[Message].
* link:spring-java-config.html[Spring Java Config] `CamelConfiguration`
now automagically detects all `RouteBuilder` instances registered in the
Spring context if `CamelConfiguration#routes` method is not overridden.
* Added support for transferring custom headers with
link:rabbitmq.html[RabbitMQ] component.
* link:crypto.html[PGPDataFormat] enables stream cache during
unmarshaling.
* `FileIdempotentRepository` now creates necessary parent directories
together with the new repository file.
* link:properties.html[Properties] component and
link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[property placeholder] will now
ignore non existing JVM and environment options as well if
`ignoreMissingLocation` is set to `true`.
* Improved link:stream.html[Stream] consumer to enrich the
link:message.html[Message] with headers about current index / completion
flag.
* Added link:bean-injection.html[`@BeanInject`] to inject beans
(obtained from the link:registry.html[Registry]) in your beans such as
`RouteBuilder` classes.
* Polished the link:karaf.html[Karaf] commands to output tables sorted
and auto calculated width, so the data is formatted nicely.
* Introduced `UnitOfWorkFactory` to allow end users to use custom
`UnitOfWork` implementations created by the factory.
* Doing request/reply over link:jms.html[JMS] allows per individual
message `requestTimeout` value by specifying the timeout value in the
`"CamelJmsRequestTimeout"` header.
* link:quartz.html[Quartz] and link:quartz2.html[Quartz2] components now
enlist the quartz scheduler by default in JMX, unless configured to be
disabled.
* link:twitter.html[Twitter] Component supports to set proxy.
* link:netty-http.html[Netty HTTP] consumer now remembers the raw (not
decoded) value of URI query in the "`CamelHttpRawQuery`" header.
* link:bean-validator.html[Bean Validator] component can be now
configured to use custom `ValidationProviderResolver`
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-7162[CAMEL-7162]) +
* TypeConverterRegistry exposes more information in JMX and allows to
browse all the registered type converters.
* link:bean-validator.html[Bean Validator] component is now shipped with
the optional OSGi-friendly `HibernateValidationProviderResolver`
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-7168[CAMEL-7168])
* link:amqp.html[AMQP] has been updated to QPid 0.24 and has been tested
using AMQP 1.0.
* Allow to turn off useOriginalMessage
(camelContext.setAllowUseOriginalMessage) which avoids a defensive copy
of the incoming original message, which can improve performance; in
situations where access to the original message is not needed.
* link:bean-validator.html[Bean Validator] component now automatically
uses OSGi-friendly `ValidationProviderResolver` if deployed in the OSGi
environment
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-7212[CAMEL-7212])
* link:async.html[Threads DSL] thread pool options and
`executorServiceRef` option are now mutually exclusive.
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-7250[CAMEL-7250])
* link:shiro-security.html[Shiro Security] now supports access control
by roles.

the link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router] will call next
predicate before triggering link:error-handler.html[Error Handler].

* Camel Spring no longer automatic registers "spring-event://default"
endpoint, which wasn't in use anyway.
* link:bam.html[BAM] component now uses raw `EntityManager` JPA API
instead of deprecated Spring `JpaTemplate`

[[Camel2.13.0Release-Changesthatmayaffectendusers]]
Changes that may affect end users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Components depending on Servlet API has been upgrade from Servlet API
2.5 to 3.0
* Jetty upgraded from 7.6.x to 8.1.x
* link:hazelcast-component.html[Hazelcast Component] uses `Object`
instead of `String` as the key.
* link:hazelcast-component.html[Hazelcast Component] atomic number
producer was using incorrect name
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-6833[CAMEL-6833]). Name
will be different with this release.
* link:hazelcast-component.html[Hazelcast Component] instance consumer
was incorrectly writing headers to the "out" message as opposed to the
"in" message. Headers are now written to the "in" message.
* link:hazelcast-component.html[Hazelcast Component] map/multimap
consumer were sending header value "envict" when an item was evicted.
This has been corrected and the value "evicted" is used now.
* The enum value `NON_BLOCKING` has been removed in `camel-apns` as its
no longer support in APNS itself.
* `DefaultTimeoutMap` must call `start` to initialize the map before
use.
* `@ExcludeRoutes` test annotation now accepts only classes implementing
`RoutesBuilder` interface.
* The MBean names registered by link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] no longer
include the hostname in the `context` part, eg before
`context=myHost/myCamelId` and now after `context=myCamelId`. Having the
hostname in the MBean name does not bring much value, and in fact makes
things more complicated as the mbean name changes depending on the host
running Camel. There is an option `includeHostName` that can be
configure as `true` to preserve the old behavior.
* link:camel-jmx.html[MBean naming] in OSGi cleaned up to use simpler
naming with symbolicName. Before we could have MBean names with
duplicate bundle ids such as `context=114-114-camel-6`, which now is
using the symbolic name instead, `context=MyApplication`.
* Added `beforeAddRoutes` and `afterAddRoutes` to
`org.apache.camel.component.servletlistener.CamelContextLifecycle` in
link:servletlistener-component.html[ServletListener Component]
* The link:language.html[Language] component now no longer caches the
compiled script as that could cause side-effects. You can set
`cacheScript=true` to enable the previous behavior if your script is
safe to do so.
* The default value of `urlDecodeHeaders` option on
link:netty-http.html[Netty HTTP] has been changed from `true` to
`false`.
* When using <jmxAgent> in spring/blueprint then the createConnector
attribute has changed default value from true to false (which is also
the default in camel-core without spring/blueprint)
* link:cache.html[camel-cache] no longer includes ehcache.xml out of the
box. Instead the default configuration from ehcache is in use, if end
user has not explicit configured a configuration file to be used.
* camel-cdi upgraded from deltaspike 0.3 to 0.5 which may affect
upgrades.
* Java DSL when using onException.backOffMultiplier or
onException.collisionAvoidancePercent/collisionAvoidanceFactor will
automatic enable backoff/collision avoidance. Before you had to
call useExponentialBackOff/useCollisionAvoidance as well. This is now
aligned how errorHandler does the same.
* changed default value
of http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/jms/Session.html#createConsumer(javax.jms.Destination,%20java.lang.String,%20boolean)[NoLocal]
from true to false in camel-sjms when creating consumer. 

[[Camel2.13.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Spring 3.1.x is no longer supported.
* Using <camelContext> in Spring will now shutdown <camelContext> eager
by default. This ensure a cleaner shutdown of Camel, as dependent <bean>
are not shutdown at this moment. The <bean> will then be shutdown after
<camelContext>. There is a new attribute shutdownEager on <camelContext>
to turn this off, and use the old behavior.
* If using `groupedExchanges` option on link:aggregator2.html[Aggregate]
EIP then the link:exchange.html[Exchange]s is now stored on the message
body as well. The old way of storing as a property is considered
deprecated. See more details at link:aggregator2.html[Aggregate].
* JMX Load statistics has been disabled by default. You can enable this
by setting loadStatisticsEnabled=true in <jmxAgent>. See more details at
link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX].
* Java 6 support is being deprecated and dropped from next release
onwards.
