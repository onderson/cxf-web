*available as of Camel 2.17*

The MLLP component is specifically designed to handle the nuances of the
MLLP protocol and provide the functionality required by Healthcare
providers to communicate with other systems using the MLLP protocol.
 The MLLP component  provides a simple configuration URI, automated HL7
acknowledgment generation and automatic acknowledgement interrogation.

The MLLP protocol does not typically use a large number of concurrent
TCP connections - a single active TCP connection is the normal case.
 Therefore, the MLLP component uses a simple thread-per-connection model
based an standard Java Sockets. This keeps the implementation simple
and eliminates the dependencies other than Camel itself.

The component supports the following:

* A Camel consumer using a TCP Server
* A Camel producer using a TCP Client

The MLLP component uses byte[] payloads, and relies on Camel Type
Conversion to convert byte[] to other types.  

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[[MLLP-MLLPConsumer]]
MLLP Consumer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MLLP Consumer supports receiving MLLP-framed messages and sending
HL7 Acknowledgements.  The MLLP Consumer can automatically generate the
HL7 Acknowledgement (HL7 Application Acknowledgements only - AA, AE and
AR), or the acknowledgement can be specified using
the CamelMllpAcknowledgement exchange property.  Additionally, the type
of acknowledgement that will be generated can be controlled by setting
the CamelMllpAcknowledgementType exchange property.

[[MLLP-MessageHeaders]]
*Message Headers*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MLLP Consumer adds these headers on the Camel message:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",]
|===========================================
|*Key* |*MSH field* |*Example*
|CamelMllpLocalAddress |  | 
|CamelMllpRemoteAddress |  | 
|CamelMllpSendingApplication |MSH-3 |APPA
|CamelMllpSendingFacility |MSH-4 |FACA
|CamelMllpReceivingApplication |MSH-5 |CAMEL
|CamelMllpReceivingFacility |MSH-6 |FACB
|CamelMllpTimestamp |MSH-7 |20150106235900
|CamelMllpSecurity |MSH-8 | 
|CamelMllpMessageType |MSH-9 |ADT^A04
|CamelMllpEventType |MSH-9-1 |AD4
|CamelMllpTriggerEvent |MSH-9-2 |A04
|CamelMllpMessageControlId |MSH-10 |12345
|CamelMllpProcessingId |MSH-11 |P
|CamelMllpVersionId |MSH-12 |2.3.1
|CamelMllpCharset |MSH-18 | 
|===========================================

All headers are String types. If a header value is missing, its value
is null.

[[MLLP-ExchangeProperties]]
*Exchange Properties*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The type of acknowledgment the MLLP Consumer generates can be controlled
by these properties on the Camel exchange:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",]
|====================================
|*Key* |  |*Example*
|CamelMllpAcknowledgement |  | 
|CamelMllpAcknowledgementType |  | AR
|====================================

All headers are String types. If a header value is missing, its value
is null.

[[MLLP-MLLPProducer]]
MLLP Producer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MLLP Producer supports sending MLLP-framed messages and receiving
HL7 Acknowledgements.  The MLLP Producer interrogates the HL7
Acknowledgments and raises exceptions if a negative acknowledgement is
received.  The received acknowledgement is interrogated and an exception
is raised in the event of a negative acknowledgement.

[[MLLP-MessageHeaders.1]]
*Message Headers*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MLLP Producer adds these headers on the Camel message:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",]
|===================================
|*Key* |*MSH field* |*Example*
|CamelMllpLocalAddress |  | 
|CamelMllpRemoteAddress |  | 
|CamelMllpAcknowledgement |  | 
|CamelMllpAcknowledgementType |  |AA
|===================================

All headers are String types. If a header value is missing, its value
is null.
