Content Filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ContentFilter.html[Content
Filter] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns]
using one of the following mechanisms in the routing logic to transform
content from the inbound message.

* link:message-translator.html[Message Translator]
* invoking a link:bean-integration.html[Java bean]
* link:processor.html[Processor] object

A common way to filter messages is to use an
link:expression.html[Expression] in the link:dsl.html[DSL] like
link:xquery.html[XQuery], link:sql.html[SQL] or one of the supported
link:scripting-languages.html[Scripting Languages].

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

Here is a simple example using the link:dsl.html[DSL] directly

In this example we add our own link:processor.html[Processor]

For further examples of this pattern in use you could look at one of the
JUnit tests

* http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/TransformTest.java?view=markup[TransformTest]
* http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/TransformViaDSLTest.java?view=markup[TransformViaDSLTest]

*Using Spring XML*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
  <from uri="activemq:Input"/>
  <bean ref="myBeanName" method="doTransform"/>
  <to uri="activemq:Output"/>
</route>
----

You can also use XPath to filter out part of the message you are
interested in:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
  <from uri="activemq:Input"/>
  <setBody><xpath resultType="org.w3c.dom.Document">//foo:bar</xpath></setBody>
  <to uri="activemq:Output"/>
</route> 
----

[[ContentFilter-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
