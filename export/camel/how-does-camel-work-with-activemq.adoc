How does Camel work with ActiveMQ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Camel to do smart routing and implement the
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] inside

* the ActiveMQ message broker
* the ActiveMQ JMS client

So Camel can route messages to and from link:mail.html[Mail],
link:file2.html[File], link:ftp2.html[FTP], link:jpa.html[JPA],
link:xmpp.html[XMPP] other link:jms.html[JMS] providers and any of the
other Camel link:components.html[Components] as well as implementating
all of the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] such as link:content-based-router.html[Content
Based Router] or link:message-translator.html[Message Translator].
