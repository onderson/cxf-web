How do I retry processing a message from a certain point back or an
entire route
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default Apache Camel will perform any redelivery (retry) attempts
from the point of failure. So if you want to retry from a point before
this, you would need to split up your route .

In the example above we have 2 routes (direct:start, direct:sub). In
case of a failure anywhere in the direct:sub route, then the entire
route is retried. This happens because we have instructed the direct:sub
route to not use any error handler (eg the no error handler). Then we
link the routes using the link:direct.html[Direct] component by calling
the sub route from the 1st route.

The code above is based on an unit test, and as you can see the
processor below is configured to fail the first 2 attempts. +
So that means the entire direct:sub route is redeliveried, meaning that
the "mock:b" endpoint receives the incoming message again.

The same example is shown below using the XML DSL:
