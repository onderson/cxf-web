Better JMS Transport for CXF Webservice using Apache Camel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring JMS in Apache CXF before Version 2.1.3 is possible but not
really easy or nice. This article shows how to use Apache Camel to
provide a better JMS Transport for CXF.

*Update:* Since CXF 2.1.3 there is a new way of configuring JMS
(http://cxf.apache.org/docs/using-the-jmsconfigfeature.html[Using the
JMSConfigFeature]). It makes JMS config for CXF as easy as with Camel.
Using Camel for JMS is still a good idea if you want to use the rich
feature of Camel for routing and other Integration Scenarios that CXF
does not support.

[[BetterJMSTransportforCXFWebserviceusingApacheCamel-SohowtoconnectApacheCamelandCXF]]
So how to connect Apache Camel and CXF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The best way to connect Camel and CXF is using the
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/camel-transport-for-cxf.html[Camel
transport for CXF]. This is a camel module that registers with cxf as a
new transport. It is quite easy to configure.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<bean class="org.apache.camel.component.cxf.transport.CamelTransportFactory">
  <property name="bus" ref="cxf" />
  <property name="camelContext" ref="camelContext" />
  <property name="transportIds">
    <list>
      <value>http://cxf.apache.org/transports/camel</value>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>
----

This bean registers with CXF and provides a new transport prefix
camel:// that can be used in CXF address configurations. The bean
references a bean cxf which will be already present in your config. The
other refrenceis a camel context. We will later define this bean to
provide the routing config.

[[BetterJMSTransportforCXFWebserviceusingApacheCamel-HowisJMSconfiguredinCamel]]
How is JMS configured in Camel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In camel you need two things to configure JMS. A ConnectionFactory and a
JMSComponent. As ConnectionFactory you can simply set up the normal
Factory your JMS provider offers or
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/xsd-config.html#xsd-config-body-schemas-jee-jndi-lookup-environment-single[bind
a JNDI ConnectionFactory]. In this example we use the ConnectionFactory
provided by ActiveMQ.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<bean id="jmsConnectionFactory" class="org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory">
  <property name="brokerURL" value="tcp://localhost:61616" />
</bean>
----

Then we set up the JMSComponent. It offers a new transport prefix to
camel that we simply call jms. If we need several JMSComponents we can
differentiate them by their name.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<bean id="jms" class="org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsComponent">
  <property name="connectionFactory" ref="jmsConnectionFactory" />
  <property name="useMessageIDAsCorrelationID" value="true" />
</bean>
----

You can find more details about the
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/jms.html[JMSComponent at the Camel
Wiki]. For example you find the complete configuration options and a
JNDI sample there.

[[BetterJMSTransportforCXFWebserviceusingApacheCamel-SettinguptheCXFclient]]
Setting up the CXF client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will configure a simple CXF webservice client. It will use stub code
generated from a wsdl. The webservice client will be configured to use
JMS directly. You can also use a direct: Endpoint and do the routing to
JMS in the Camel Context.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<client id="CustomerService" xmlns="http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws" xmlns:customer="http://customerservice.example.com/"
  serviceName="customer:CustomerServiceService"
  endpointName="customer:CustomerServiceEndpoint"
  address="camel:jms:queue:CustomerService"
  serviceClass="com.example.customerservice.CustomerService">
</client>
----

We explicitly configure serviceName and endpointName so they are not
read from the wsdl. The names we use are arbitrary and have no further
function but we set them to look nice. The serviceclass points to the
service interface that was generated from the wsdl. Now the important
thing is address. Here we tell cxf to use the camel transport, use the
JmsComponent who registered the prefix "jms" and use the queue
"CustomerService".

[[BetterJMSTransportforCXFWebserviceusingApacheCamel-SettinguptheCamelContext]]
Setting up the CamelContext
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As we do not need additional routing an empty
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/spring.html[CamelContext] bean will
suffice.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<camelContext id="camelContext" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
</camelContext>
----

Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

As you have seen in this example you can use Camel to connect services
to JMS easily while being able to also use the rich integration features
of Apache Camel.
