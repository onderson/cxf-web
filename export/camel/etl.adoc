Extract Transform Load (ETL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load[ETL] (Extract,
Transform, Load) is a mechanism for loading data into systems or
databases using some kind of link:data-format.html[Data Format] from a
variety of sources; often files then using
link:pipes-and-filters.html[Pipes and Filters],
link:message-translator.html[Message Translator] and possible other
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns].

So you could query data from various Camel
link:components.html[Components] such as link:file2.html[File],
link:http.html[HTTP] or link:jpa.html[JPA], perform multiple patterns
such as link:splitter.html[Splitter] or
link:message-translator.html[Message Translator] then send the messages
to some other link:component.html[Component].

To show how this all fits together, try the link:etl-example.html[ETL
Example]
