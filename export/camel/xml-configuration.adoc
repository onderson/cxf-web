Xml Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend developers use the Java link:dsl.html[Domain Specific
Language] when writing routing rules as this provides maximum IDE
completion and functionality while being the most expressive. However if
you wish to put your routing rules in XML you can via the Camel XML
language.

Camel XML uses link:spring.html[Spring] 2 namespaces; so that you can
configure your routing rules within your link:spring.html[Spring XML
configuration file]; you can also use
link:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.html[Java code to configure components
and endpoints].

For examples on how to use Camel XML, see the
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] or refer to the link:spring.html[Spring Support].
