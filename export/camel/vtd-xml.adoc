VTD-XML
~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.10*

The VTD-XML component supports the
http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net/[VTD-XML Library] for very fast and
efficient link:xpath.html[XPath] processing. The *camel-vtdxml* library
is provided by the http://code.google.com/p/camel-extra/[Camel Extra]
project which hosts all *GPL related components for Camel.

[[VTD-XML-Using]]
Using
^^^^^

The VTD-XML is implemented as a Camel link:language.html[Language] which
allows you to easily use it in the Camel routes. +
This component is particular efficient for splitting files or other big
payloads.

For example to split a big file containing many persons, you could do:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    from("file:inbox")
      .split().vtdxml("/persons/person").streaming()
        .to("activemq:queue:person")
      .end()
----

And in XML DSL

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
   <from uri="file:inbox"/>
   <split streaming="true">
     <vtdxml>/persons/person</vtdxml>
     <to uri="activemq:queue:person"/>
   </split>
</route>
----

This will run the link:splitter.html[Splitter] in streaming mode using
the *vtdxml* language.
