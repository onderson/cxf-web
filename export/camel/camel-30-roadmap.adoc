Camel 3.0 Roadmap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This page contains a summary of the link:camel-30-ideas.html[ideas]
planned for the camel-3.0.0 release.

[[Camel3.0-Roadmap-Tasksforcamel-2.x(prepare)]]
Tasks for camel-2.x (prepare)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[Camel3.0-Roadmap-Improvethetestapifortestingcomponents(jwcarman)]]
Improve the test api for testing components (jwcarman)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-6029[CAMEL-6029].

No matter what choices and changes we make in the core, many tests in
components will start failing. That is because virtually all unit tests
in components test much more than the component itself, by setting up
routes, etc. A simple thing would be do create something like
xyzTestSupport (where xyz in \{"Component", "Configuration", "Endpoint",
"Producer", "Consumer", "Language", etc... }), that test a respective
area without setting up routes and possibly use a minimal CamelContext
(w/o component discover and/or other features). Moving component unit
tests to such a framework is not complicated, a bit tedious, but
hopefully we'll benefit (yet again) from community contributions and
gain new committers in the process. This is probably the first thing
that should be done that will allow us to be more productive with the
other improvements. It can also be done in 2.x and won't require any
incompatible changes.

Tasks for camel-3.0.0 (execute)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[Camel3.0-Roadmap-RemovethexxxRefoptionsfromourURI(cmueller)]]
Remove the xxxRef options from our URI (cmueller)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-6076[CAMEL-6076]

In favor of the xxx options in our URI, we should remove the duplicated
xxxRef options from our components. This make our code and documentation
more lean. We should deprecate it as soon as possible and remove it in
Camel 3.0.

[[Camel3.0-Roadmap-Unifyuri/refinourendpoints(cmueller)]]
Unify uri/ref in our endpoints (cmueller)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-6077[CAMEL-6077]

Instead of having both uri and ref for endpoints, we should unify this
and only use uri. If people want to use ref, then they can do that using
"ref:xx" as an uri. This would simplify code as we don't have to check
for either one.

[[Camel3.0-Roadmap-PluggableMessageStorefortemporaryorpermanentstorageofexchanges(ohr)]]
Pluggable Message Store for temporary or permanent storage of exchanges
(ohr)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
