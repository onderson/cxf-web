Selective Consumer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageSelector.html[Selective
Consumer] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns] can be implemented in two ways

The first solution is to provide a Message Selector to the underlying
link:uris.html[URIs] when creating your consumer. For example when using
link:jms.html[JMS] you can specify a selector parameter so that the
message broker will only deliver messages matching your criteria.

The other approach is to use a link:message-filter.html[Message Filter]
which is applied; then if the filter matches the message your consumer
is invoked as shown in the following example

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

*Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]*

Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
