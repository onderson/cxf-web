[[Tutorial-Example-ReportIncident-Part5-...ContinuedfromPart4]]
... Continued from Part 4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We continue from part 4 where we have the routing in place. However as
you might have noticed we aren't quiet there yet with a nice solution,
we are still coding to much. In this part we will look into to address
these two concerns:

* Starting Camel automatically
* Using CXF directly

[[Tutorial-Example-ReportIncident-Part5-StartingCamelautomatically]]
Starting Camel automatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our current deployment model is as a war and we have the `web.xml` to
help start things. Well in fact we will leverage Spring to start the
world
image:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/s/en_GB/5997/6f42626d00e36f53fe51440403446ca61552e2a2.1/_/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png[(wink)].
We use it's ContextListener

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <!-- the listener that kick-starts Spring -->
    <listener>
        <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
    </listener>
----

Then we need a standard Spring XML file so we create a new file in
`src/main/resources` and name it *camel-config.xml*. Before we start
editing this XML file we need to link to it from the web.xml file. So we
add this snippet to the web.xml:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <!-- location of spring xml files -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
            <param-value>classpath:camel-config.xml</param-value>
    </context-param>
----

Now we are ready to edit the *camel-config.xml* file that is a standard
Spring XML bean file. So you can add standard spring beans and whatnot
you like to do and can do with Spring.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd">

</beans>
----

Now we are nearly there, we just need to add Camel to the Spring XML
file, so Spring knows Camel exists and can start it. First we need to
add Camel to the schema location in the top of the XML file.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
       ...
       xsi:schemaLocation="
            http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd">
----

Now we are ready to let link:spring.html[Spring and Camel] work
together. What we need to do is adding a
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] to the Spring XML file. Camel ships
with a CamelContextFactoryBean that is a Spring factory bean we should
use for creating and initializing the SpringCamelContext.
SpringCamelContext is extending CamelContext to be Spring aware so Camel
and Spring can work nicely together. For instance the
link:registry.html[Registry] will now use Spring bean lookup. So any
spring bean can now easily be lookup and used from Camel. Well back to
today's lesson. So we can create a SpringCamelContext using the factory
bean as illustrated below:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
   <bean id="camel" class="org.apache.camel.spring.CamelContextFactoryBean"/>
----

However this is not used very often as Spring has support for custom
namespace, so Camel has a CamelNamespaceHandler so we can create Camel
using nice XML syntax as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
       ...
    </camelContext>
----

[[Tutorial-Example-ReportIncident-Part5-Addingroutebuilder]]
Adding route builder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we have Camel integrated but we still need to add our route bulder
that we did manually from the javacode as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    // append the routes to the context
    context.addRoutes(new ReportIncidentRoutes());
----

There are two solutions to this

* using spring bean
* package scanning

Using a spring bean we just declare the route builder using a regular
spring bean:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
   <bean id="myrouter" class="org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentRoutes"/>
----

And then we can refer to it from our CamelContext:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
       <routeBuilderRef ref="myrouter"/>
    </camelContext>
----

So now when Spring start's it will read the *camel-context.xml* file and
thus also start Camel as well. As SpringCamelContext is spring lifecycle
event aware, Camel will also shutdown when Spring is shutting down. So
when you stop the web application Spring will notify this and Camel is
also shutdown nice and properly. So as an end user no need to worry.

The package scanning solution is for convenience to refer to a java
package and Camel will scan all classes within this package for
RouteBuilder classes. If using this then you dont need to declare your
route builder as a Spring bean. So the XML can be reduced to.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
       <package>org.apache.camel.example.reportincident</package>
    </camelContext>
----

[[Tutorial-Example-ReportIncident-Part5-UsingCXFdirectly]]
Using CXF directly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we have seen how you can leverage link:spring.html[Spring] to start
Camel, in fact it handles the lifecycle of Camel, so you can say Camel
is embedded with Spring in your application.

From the very start of this tutorial we have used CXF as the webservice
framework and we haven't integrated it directly with Camel as it can do
out-of-the-box. Camel ships with a link:cxf.html[*camel-cxf*] component
for integrating CXF directly within Camel routing. In our tutorial we
are exposing a webservice so we want continue to do this. Before we
continue let's recap at what the webservice implementation we have from
part 4

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
/**
 * The webservice we have implemented.
 */
public class ReportIncidentEndpointImpl implements ReportIncidentEndpoint {

    private CamelContext context;

    public ReportIncidentEndpointImpl() throws Exception {
        // create the context
        context = new DefaultCamelContext();

        // append the routes to the context
        context.addRoutes(new ReportIncidentRoutes());

        // at the end start the camel context
        context.start();
    }

    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        // create the producer template to use for sending messages
        ProducerTemplate producer = context.createProducerTemplate();
        // send the body and the filename defined with the special header key
        Object mailBody = producer.sendBody("direct:start", parameters);
        System.out.println("Body:" + mailBody);

        // return an OK reply
        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }

}
----

We have already seen how we can get Spring starting Camel so the
constructor method can be removed. What next is that the CamelContext
needed in this code should be the one from our *camel-context.xml* file.
So we change the code to use a plain setter injection (we can use Spring
annotations and whatelse but we keep it simple with a setter):

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
/**
 * The webservice we have implemented.
 */
public class ReportIncidentEndpointImpl implements ReportIncidentEndpoint {

    private CamelContext context;

    public void setCamelContext(CamelContext context) {
        this.context = context;
    }

    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        // create the producer template to use for sending messages
        ProducerTemplate producer = context.createProducerTemplate();
        // send the body and the filename defined with the special header key
        Object mailBody = producer.sendBody("direct:start", parameters);
        System.out.println("Body:" + mailBody);

        // return an OK reply
        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }

}
----

And then we need to instruct Spring to set this property. Turning back
to cxf-config.xml from part 4 we can add a reference to our camel
context

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:jaxws="http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd
            http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws http://cxf.apache.org/schemas/jaxws.xsd">

    <import resource="classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf-extension-soap.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf-servlet.xml"/>

    <!-- implementation of the webservice, and we refer to our camel context with the id = camel from camel-context.xml -->
    <bean id="reportIncidentEndpoint" class="org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentEndpointImpl">
       <property name="context" ref="camel"/>
    </bean>

    <!-- export the webservice using jaxws -->
    <jaxws:endpoint id="reportIncident"
                    implementor="#reportIncidentEndpoint"
                    address="/incident"
                    wsdlLocation="/WEB-INF/wsdl/report_incident.xml"
                    endpointName="s:ReportIncidentPort"
                    serviceName="s:ReportIncidentService"
                    xmlns:s="http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org"/>
</beans>
----

So now we have two spring XML files

* cxf-config.xml
* camel-config.xml

And since *cxf-config.xml* is dependent on *camel-config.xml* we need to
have correct ordering in our web.xml where we have defined the XML files
to load by Spring. So we set the *camel-config.xml* before the
*cxf-config.xml* so Spring have created the SpringCamelContext and
registered it in its registry with the id = camel.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <!-- location of spring xml files -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
        <param-value>classpath:camel-config.xml</param-value>
        <param-value>classpath:cxf-config.xml</param-value>
    </context-param>
----

**Sidenote on spring XML files**

The solution presented here with two spring XML files (cxf-config and
camel-config) that is pendent on each other and thus has to be ordered
can also be done using a different solution. You can for instance add an
*import* in cxf-config and only have the cxf-config listed in web.xml.
Another solution is to merge the two files into one combined file. Yes
you can add the camelContext in the cxf-config file.

But hey this isn't using link:cxf.html[CXF] directly in the routing? Yes
it's not but I wanted to show the halfway solution as well. What we have
now is having Spring creating and handling lifecycle of Camel and
showing how you can inject CamelContext using standard Spring into
whatever code you have. This is very powerful as you can use the
solution that you (or your team) already master and is familiar with. If
they have Spring experience then the IoC principle of injecting
resources is of course also possible with Camel as well. In fact it's a
best practice principle. Later you will learn that you can inject other
Camel types such as link:endpoint.html[Endpoint],
link:producertemplate.html[ProducerTemplate] as well.

[[Tutorial-Example-ReportIncident-Part5-Usingthecamel-cxfcomponent]]
Using the camel-cxf component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Okay let's continue and try to integrate link:cxf.html[CXF] directly
into our routing in Camel. This can be a bit more tricky than at first
sight. Our goal is to avoid implementing the `ReportIncidentEndpoint` as
we did with our code in `ReportIncidentEndpointImpl` (see above). Camel
should be able to handle this automatically and integrate directly
within our route.

Before we started our routing using the link:direct.html[Direct]
endpoint with `"direct:start"`. We should replace this with the
link:cxf.html[CXF] endpoint.

But before going to far we have to make a few adjustments to the .wsdl
file and it's location in our project folder. We move
*report_incident.wsdl* from src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl* to
*src/main/resources* as we want to be able to refer to it from within
our route builder from Java code and thus it should be on the classpath
for easy access. Secondly we have upgrade the CXF to a newer version and
it identified a minor issue with the .wsdl file itself. We have to give
the complexType a name otherwise we get some JAXB error.

So the .wsdl should be changed from:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <xs:element name="inputReportIncident">
        <xs:complexType>
----

To include a name attribute of the complex types:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <xs:element name="inputReportIncident">
        <xs:complexType name="inputReportIncident">
----

[[Tutorial-Example-ReportIncident-Part5-UsingCXFendpoint]]
Using CXF endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Okay now we are ready to turn our attention to using link:cxf.html[CXF]
directly in Camel routing. So we zap `ReportIncidentEndpointImpl` as we
no longer need this code. So what's left is:

* `FilenameGenerator.java`
* `ReportIncidentRoutes.java` +
And that is all what's needed, well for now...
image:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/s/en_GB/5997/6f42626d00e36f53fe51440403446ca61552e2a2.1/_/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png[(wink)]

The goal is to replace the previous staring endpoint ("direct:start") to
the new starting link:cxf.html[CXF] endpoint.

link:cxf.html[CXF] endpoint can be configured in either or both CXF
spring configuration file or/and in the route directly. It accepts one
parameter and others are optional. The parameter it *must* have is the
service class. The service class is the interface for the WSDL
operation's. As we have the *wsdl2java* goal to generate this class for
us, we have it already as
`org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentEndpoint`.

The other parameter we will provide is the url to the .wsdl file. And
finally we must provide the http address we expose the webservice at.
The URI is therefore:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // endpoint to our CXF webservice
        String cxfEndpoint = "cxf://http://localhost:8080/part-five/webservices/incident"
                + "?serviceClass=org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentEndpoint"
                + "&wsdlURL=report_incident.wsdl";
----

Then we can replace "direct:start" with our cxf endpoint instead, so
it's:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        from(cxfEndpoint)...
----

The next issue you might now have guessed is that before (in part 4) we
did a traditional codeing style to start a task and return a response to
the caller in the method:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
  public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        // create the producer template to use for sending messages
        ProducerTemplate producer = context.createProducerTemplate();
        // send the body and the filename defined with the special header key
        Object mailBody = producer.sendBody("direct:start", parameters);
        System.out.println("Body:" + mailBody);

        // return an OK reply
        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }
----

As you can see the method `reportIncident` is invoked with the
webservice input parameters and we return the response to to the
webservice from the method. But our situation now is that we don't have
this method anymore. So how do we return a response to the webservice?

Houston we have a problem! Well of course not but the mindset have to be
changed slightly to understand the routing concept, and how it works. So
let's step back a bit. What we have here is a webservice that we expose.
And our webservice is synchronous request/response based so the caller
waits for a response. This is a InOut Message Exchange Pattern. Camel
will default use InOut for webservices so we don't need to specify this
explicitly. When we have a InOut pattern then Camel will return the
response to the original caller when the routes ends. Looking at our
route we have:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        from(cxfEndpoint)
            // then set the file name using the FilenameGenerator bean
            .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, BeanLanguage.bean(FilenameGenerator.class, "generateFilename"))
            // transform the message using velocity to generate the mail message
            .to("velocity:MailBody.vm")
            // and store the file    
            .to("file://target/subfolder")
----

When the route ends after the file endpoint has been processed Camel
will return the OUT message to the original caller (the caller of the
webservice). However our route currently as it stands have not set any
OUT message, so this is what we need to do,
link:message-translator.html[transforming (Message Translator EIP)] the
message into the response. We will therefore use a processor where we
have 100% control in the Java code to set the response.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
            // the response we want to send
            OutputReportIncident OK = new OutputReportIncident();
            OK.setCode("0");

            // set the response on the OUT message as we use InOut
            exchange.getOut().setBody(OK);
       }
----

And with the route:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // first part from the webservice -> file backup
        from(cxfEndpoint)
            // then set the file name using the FilenameGenerator bean
            .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, BeanLanguage.bean(FilenameGenerator.class, "generateFilename"))
            // transform the message using velocity to generate the mail message
            .to("velocity:MailBody.vm")
            // and store the file    
            .to("file://target/subfolder")
            // return OK as response
            .process(new Processor() {
                public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                    // the response we want to send
                    OutputReportIncident OK = new OutputReportIncident();
                    OK.setCode("0");

                    // set the response on the OUT message as we use InOut
                    exchange.getOut().setBody(OK);
                }
            });
----

The route using the inlined processor is a bit ugly as we have high
level routing logic combined with low level java code. First of all I
wanted to show how flexible Camel is, allowing use as a developer to
always be in control and can use Java code for whatever you needs is.
First of all we could move the code into a inner class and just refer to
it:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private static class OKResponseProcessor implements Processor {
        public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
            // the response we want to send
            OutputReportIncident OK = new OutputReportIncident();
            OK.setCode("0");

            // set the response on the OUT message as we use InOut
            exchange.getOut().setBody(OK);
        }
    }
----

And then out route is much nicer:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // first part from the webservice -> file backup
        from(cxfEndpoint)
            // then set the file name using the FilenameGenerator bean
            .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, BeanLanguage.bean(FilenameGenerator.class, "generateFilename"))
            // transform the message using velocity to generate the mail message
            .to("velocity:MailBody.vm")
            // and store the file    
            .to("file://target/subfolder")
            // return OK as response
            .process(new OKResponseProcessor());
----

Since our response is static and we don't need to any code logic to set
it we can use the *transform* DSL in the route to set a constant OUT
message. So we refactor the code a bit to loose the processor. First we
define the OK response as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // webservice response for OK 
        OutputReportIncident OK = new OutputReportIncident();
        OK.setCode("0");
----

And then we can refer to it in the route as a constant expression:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    // return OK as response
    .transform(constant(OK));
----

[[Tutorial-Example-ReportIncident-Part5-ImportantissueregardingusingendpointsinCamel]]
Important issue regarding using link:cxf.html[CXF] endpoints in Camel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we are nearly there, there is an important issue left with using
link:cxf.html[CXF] endpoints in Camel. In part 4 we started the route by
sending the InputReportIncident object containing the webservice input.
Now we are using link:cxf.html[CXF] endpoints directly in our routing so
its a CxfExchange that is created and passed in the routing. CxfExchange
stores the payload in a CXF holder class
`org.apache.cxf.message.MessageContentsList`. So to be able to get our
InputReportIncident class we need to get this object from the holder
class. For this we show how it's done in Java using a processor, then
later we show a nicer solution.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public void process(final Exchange exchange) {
    // Get the parameter list
    List parameter = exchange.getIn().getBody(List.class);
    // Get the first object in the list that is our InputReportIncident
    Object input = parameter.get(0);
    // replace with our input
    exchange.getOut().setBody(input);
}
----

Well this isn't the nicest code, but again we want to show how it's done
using plain Java, that is actually how Camel also can assist you in this
nicer solution - we simply convert the body to the expected type using
*convertBodyTo*. This is an important feature in Camel and you can use
it for other situations as well.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // first part from the webservice -> file backup
        from(cxfEndpoint)
            // we need to convert the CXF payload to InputReportIncident that FilenameGenerator and velocity expects
            .convertBodyTo(InputReportIncident.class)
            // then set the file name using the FilenameGenerator bean
            .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, BeanLanguage.bean(FilenameGenerator.class, "generateFilename"))
            // transform the message using velocity to generate the mail message
            .to("velocity:MailBody.vm")
            // and store the file    
            .to("file://target/subfolder")
            // return OK as response
            .transform(constant(OK));
----

Now the route is nice and simple.

[[Tutorial-Example-ReportIncident-Part5-Unittesting]]
Unit testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now lets turn our attention to unit testing it. From part 4 we have an
unit test that is capable of exposing a webservice and send a test
request and assert a mail is received. We will refactor this unit test
to start up Camel, as it's Camel that should expose the webservice.

As Camel is very flexible we can create a camel context, add the routes
and start it in 3 lines of code so we do it:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    protected void startCamel() throws Exception {
        camel = new DefaultCamelContext();
        camel.addRoutes(new ReportIncidentRoutes());
        camel.start();
----

And the rest of the unit test is quite self documenting so we print it
here in full:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
/**
 * Unit test of our routes
 */
public class ReportIncidentRoutesTest extends TestCase {

    private CamelContext camel;

    // should be the same address as we have in our route
    private static String ADDRESS = "http://localhost:8080/part-five/webservices/incident";

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

We have now seen how we have created a much nicer solution leveraging
Camel's powerful routing capabilities.

What we have here is routing logic with the help of the code comments
could be understood by non developers. This is very powerful. In a later
part we will look at some of the tools that Camel provides, for instance
a tool to link:visualisation.html[generate a nice diagrams] of your
routes

    public void configure() throws Exception {
        // webservice response for OK
        OutputReportIncident OK = new OutputReportIncident();
        OK.setCode("0");

        // endpoint to our CXF webservice
        String cxfEndpoint = "cxf://http://localhost:8080/part-five/webservices/incident"
                + "?serviceClass=org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentEndpoint"
                + "&wsdlURL=report_incident.wsdl";

        // first part from the webservice -> file backup
        from(cxfEndpoint)
            // we need to convert the CXF payload to InputReportIncident that FilenameGenerator and velocity expects
            .convertBodyTo(InputReportIncident.class)
            // then set the file name using the FilenameGenerator bean
            .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, BeanLanguage.bean(FilenameGenerator.class, "generateFilename"))
            // and create the mail body using velocity templating
            .to("velocity:MailBody.vm")
            // and store the file
            .to("file://target/subfolder")
            // return OK as response
            .transform(constant(OK));

        // second part from the file backup -> send email
        from("file://target/subfolder")
            // set the subject of the email
            .setHeader("subject", constant("new incident reported"))
            // send the email
            .to("smtp://someone@localhost?password=secret&to=incident@mycompany.com");
    }

In the next part's look at using XML to create the route instead of Java
code. Then it might be even more readable by non developers.
