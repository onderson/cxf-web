Camel 2.3 - Overhaul of Aggregator EIP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The link:aggregator.html[Aggregator] EIP needs an overhaul in Camel to
remedy a few new features, improvements and fix an issue with using
completion predicate and timeout.

[[Camel2.3-OverhaulofAggregatorEIP-Currentissues]]
Current issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Build on top of BatchProcessor which has to complex logic for
concurrent locking and accepting new messages.
* BatchProcessor was originally designed to help with batch and
transactions
* Either BatchProcessor needs to be reworked or a new base class
implemented
* Completion predicate and batch timeout does not work together
* Batch timeout is actually a interval check timeout
* AggregationStrategy is invoked to _late_ as its only invoked when the
batch timeout triggers
* BatchSender is single threaded

[[Camel2.3-OverhaulofAggregatorEIP-NewDesign]]
New Design
^^^^^^^^^^

* BatchSender should use ExecutorsService that ensures if a thread is
dead a new thread will be started, eg the task is always running. *DONE*
* BatchSender is currently only a single thread. We should support
concurrency, so you can have multiple output based on per correlation
key. *DONE*
* BatchSender should have simpler logic for enqueing and locking if
possible. *DONE*
* BatchProcessor should support persistent, so aggregated exchanges can
be stored in a database using link:jpa.html[JPA]. See how we do this
with the link:idempotent-consumer.html[Idempotent Consumer] and/or
link:tracer.html[Tracer]. *DONE*
* If possible: AggregationStrategy should be invoked on the fly so you
in the future can use it to determine if we are complete. *DONE*
* Batch timeout and completion predicate should work together so the
completion is triggered by the first one. *DONE*
* Batch timeout should be per correlation key based, and not a single
global timeout. *DONE*
* Add POJO based aggregation strategy so you can avoid using the low
level Exchange APIs
* Add option what to do in case the correlation key cannot be evaluated,
eg to ignore or throw an exception back to caller. *DONE*
* Add option to ignore to _late_ exchanges if a correlation key has been
_closed_. *DONE*
* Look all JIRA tickets at Apache what we have for the
link:aggregator.html[Aggregator] *DONE*
* link:resequencer.html[Resequencer] is also using the `BatchProcessor`
so we should ensure it works as well and maybe it can benefit some of
the new features as well.
* Add persistent AggregationRepository out of the box *DONE*
* Configuration of completion options should be more dynamic such as
timeout and size *DONE*
