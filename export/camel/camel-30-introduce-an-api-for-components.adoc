Currently each component needs to depend on the camel-core. So it sucks
in a lot more than it really needs.

The idea is to define a minimal API that contains everything a typical
component needs. This API should be as independent of the camel
implementation as possible. +
Optionally we could aim for an API that is so general that it can also
be a base for CXF and Servicemix.

The main issue currently is the CamelContext. It references to everthing
else and so makes it necessary to suck in all camel-core. So what we
need to do is create a subset that I call RuntimeCamelContext. This
should only contain the things needed at runtime. It should also only
refrence to interfaces so we do not suck in implementations.

It may also be a good idea to define specialized interfaces for parts of
the CamelContext. For example we could have an exchange Factory. Most
endpoints need the CamelContext only to create exchanges so this may be
everything they need.

So what should the API contain:

* Exchange
* Message
* Component
* Endpoint
* Producer
* Consumer
* RuntimeCamelContext

What should the API not contain:

* CamelContext: The camelcontext currently references to almost
everything
