How to upgrade a Camel dependency
---------------------------------

[[Upgradedependencyguide-1.OpenanJIRAissue]]
1. Open an JIRA issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open an JIRA issue at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL, if it
does not already exist. +
The issue type should be "Task". A sample can be found here:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3471

[[Upgradedependencyguide-2.Changetheparentpom]]
2. Change the parent pom
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All dependency versions are managed in the parent pom. Change the
version number for the dependency you want to upgrade in this file.

[[Upgradedependencyguide-3.Customizethesourcecode(ifnecessary)]]
3. Customize the source code (if necessary)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this upgrade is a major change (e.g. from Apache Mina 1.1.7 to
2.0.2), it could require some source code and/or test customizations. Be
careful with changes in the unit tests!

[[Upgradedependencyguide-4.AskforanOSGI-fiedversion(ifnecessary)]]
4. Ask for an OSGI-fied version (if necessary)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this dependency is not available as an OSGI bundle, ask the Apache
Servicemix guys for an OSGI-fied version of this dependency. You should
do this by opening a JIRA issue at
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SMX4 +
The issue type should be "Task". A sample can be found here:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SMX4-699

[[Upgradedependencyguide-5.Changetheplatform/karafpom(ifnecessary)]]
5. Change the platform/karaf pom (if necessary)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a new OSGI-fied version of this dependency is provided, update the
platform/karaf pom with the new version.

[[Upgradedependencyguide-6.Validatethefeatures.xml(ifnecessary)]]
6. Validate the features.xml (if necessary)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you change anything in the features.xml from platform/karaf you
should run a validation test to ensure the generated features.xml file
is correct. You can do this running the following maven goal from the
platform directory.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn clean install -Pvalidate
----

[[Upgradedependencyguide-7.Runacompletebuild]]
7. Run a complete build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure you don't break anything with your upgrade, run a complete
build from the Camel root directory:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn clean install
----
