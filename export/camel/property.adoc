Property Expression Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Property Expression Language allows you to extract values of named
exchange properties.

From *Camel 2.15* onwards the property language has been renamed to
exchangeProperty to avoid ambiguity, confusion and clash with properties
as a general term. So use exchangeProperty instead of property when
using Camel 2.15 onwards.

[[Property-Exampleusage]]
Example usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The recipientList element of the Spring DSL can utilize a property
expression like:

\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/recipientListWithStringDelimitedProperty.xml}

In this case, the list of recipients are contained in the property
'myProperty'.

And the same example in Java DSL:

\{snippet:id=example|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/RecipientListWithStringDelimitedPropertyTest.java}

And with a slightly different syntax where you use the builder to the
fullest (i.e. avoid using parameters but using stacked operations,
notice that property is not a parameter but a stacked method call)

java from("direct:a").recipientList().property("myProperty");

Dependencies
