CI builds using Jenkins
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Continuous integration builds for Apache Camel have been set up at
https://builds.apache.org/. More information about using Jenkins at
Apache can be found at http://wiki.apache.org/general/Jenkins. +
If you are a Camel PMC member and would like to have access to the
JenkinsÂ administration, you can find instructions for getting your own
user id on the same wiki page.

We have several jobs available for Apache Camel:

* https://builds.apache.org/job/Camel.trunk.fulltest.java7/
* https://builds.apache.org/job/Camel.trunk.fulltest.java8/
* https://builds.apache.org/job/Camel.trunk.itest.karaf/
* https://builds.apache.org/job/Camel.trunk.itest.osgi/

Sonar leverages well-known tools such as Checkstyle, PMD, Findbugs,
Cobertura, Clover and JavaNCSS to provide an integrated and easy to use
quality management platform. The Sonar guys were kind enough to add
Camel to their public server at Codehaus

Access to Jenkins administration is currently being limited to PMC
members by the Apache Infrastructure team, but several PMC members
already have an account on these machines so you can just contact the
link:mailing-lists.html[developer mailing list] for any problems or
suggestions with the way the builds have been set up.
