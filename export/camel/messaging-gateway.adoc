Messaging Gateway
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel has several endpoint components that support the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessagingGateway.html[Messaging
Gateway] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns].

Components like link:bean.html[Bean] and link:cxf.html[CXF] provide a a
way to bind a Java interface to the message exchange.

However you may want to read the link:using-camelproxy.html[Using
CamelProxy] documentation as a true
link:messaging-gateway.html[Messaging Gateway] EIP solution. +
Another approach is to use `@Produce` which you can read about in
link:pojo-producing.html[POJO Producing] which also can be used as a
link:messaging-gateway.html[Messaging Gateway] EIP solution.

 

[[MessagingGateway-Example]]
Example
+++++++

The following example how
the link:cxf.html[CXF] and link:bean.html[Bean] components can be used
to abstract the developer from the underlying messaging system API

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("cxf:bean:soapMessageEndpoint")
    .to("bean:testBean?method=processSOAP");
----

 

**Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]**

[source,brush:,xml;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
    <from uri="cxf:bean:soapMessageEndpoint"/>
    <to uri="bean:testBean?method=processSOAP"/>
</route>

[[MessagingGateway-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
