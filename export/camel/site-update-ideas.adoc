Rationale
---------

There is a growing sense in the community that the Camel Web site needs
some updating. The
http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/DISCUSS-Apache-Camel-website-facelift-td3202031.html#a3202031[precipitating
e-mail] cited a few key areas to look at:

1.  a new logo
2.  refreshed look and feel for the site
3.  clearer navigation
4.  clearer organization of the documentation

In addition the idea of attempting to align the branding of Camel with
ServiceMix, CXF, ActiveMQ, and Karaf was floated. The idea being that
the projects are closely aligned and frequently used together.

A final consideration is that the Apache Infrastructure group is
beginning the process of deprecating Confluence due to a lack of support
for the static HTML export plug-in. They have outlined plans to have all
projects host their Web sites from SVN. The infrastructure group is
implementing a CMS system that is currently in use for the main Apache
site. However, they are willing to support any tool chain that produces
HTML for publication from SVN.

Recently the board produced a set of
http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs[guidelines] that all
projects must implement early next year regarding branding and Web
sites.

[[SiteUpdateIdeas-ProposedSolutions]]
Proposed Solutions
------------------

The proposals cover two general areas:

* site design
* site generation

[[SiteUpdateIdeas-SiteDesign]]
Site Design
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ServiceMix community has been knocking ideas for a site design
around for awhile. There discussions are archived at:

* http://servicemix.396122.n5.nabble.com/Discussion-Web-site-updating-tp3212916.html
* http://servicemix.396122.n5.nabble.com/Scalate-Web-site-tp3237715.html

The generally agreed upon items from the ServiceMix discussion are:

* make it easy for a user to find the most current download for their
platform
* make it easy for a user to find documentation and support
* make it easy for interested parties to learn about the community
* boxes highlighting the three main areas are desirable
* a twitter widget is desirable
* simplified navigation is desirable

Lukasz Dywicki, who is helping update the design of the ServiceMix site,
has volunteered some design effort to the Camel community. Attached are
two of his proposals:

[[SiteUpdateIdeas-SiteGeneration]]
Site Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The three current ideas for generating the site include:

1.  sticking with Confluence
2.  using the CMS under development by the Infrastructure team
3.  using http://scalate.fusesource.org[Scalate]

Sticking with Confluence is not a realistic long term solution given the
Apache Foundation's expressed intent to deprecate Confluence for static
sites.

The Infrastructure CMS is still an unknown entity and is intended to
support a number of site generation plug-ins. Any solution we choose
will need to work with the Infrastructure publishing system if not
directly with the CMS.

Scalate is a powerful and flexible Web framework that allows for a
number of mark-up languages, including Confluence mark-up, as well as
number of dynamic Web capabilities. James Strachan has already started a
port of the existing Camel site as a test bed for Scalate. The project
is hosted at Github (https://github.com/jstrachan/camel-docs). To get
the code and build the site do the following:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
git clone https://github.com/jstrachan/camel-docs.git
cd camel-docs
mvn jetty:run
----

ServiceMix is also experimenting with Scalate. There is a sandbox
project for a new ServiceMix Web site based on Scalate that can be
checked out using SVN at
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/servicemix/sandbox/website20. To get the
code and build the site do the following:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/servicemix/sandbox/website20
cd website20
mvn jetty:run
----

Gert Vanthienen has started a ServiceMix documentation project using
Scalate as well. It is also hosted at Github
(https://github.com/apache/servicemix-documentation). To get the code
and build the site do the following:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
git clone https://github.com/apache/servicemix-documentation.git
cd servicemix-documentation
mvn jetty:run
----

Scalate sites can be viewed by pointing your Web browser to
http://localhost:8080.

[[SiteUpdateIdeas-Issues]]
Issues
------

[[SiteUpdateIdeas-BarriertoEntryforContributors]]
Barrier to Entry for Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the issues raised revolve around the fact that any solution
involving putting the site under version control, which Infrastructure
will begin requiring in 2011, makes it more difficult for people to
contribute to the documentation.

Hadrian raises the issue here:
http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/helping-out-with-the-Web-site-tp3257543p3258674.html.

The current Confluence implementation requires that contributors have a
signed CLA on file before karma can be granted. As Dan K. points
out(http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/helping-out-with-the-Web-site-tp3257543p3258768.html),
the CLA requirement makes the barrier to entry pretty steep already.

Putting the site content in SVN means that contributors will be required
to submit changes as patches through JIRA and explicitly grant license
to the ASF for inclusion in the Camel project. Committers will be
required to review and apply the patches. This aligns the process of
contributing documentation with contributing code and requires an extra
effort from the committers.

Using SVN directly changes the nature of the barrier to entry. Opinions
vary about the merits of changing the barrier to entry. Some feel that
making people use SVN and JIRA will scare away some newbies and people
who just want to contribute documentation. Others argue that it is no
big deal and that the barrier for making documentation changes should be
the same.

In the long run, this will be a moot point since Infrastructure is going
to require that a project's static site is stored in SVN. A wiki based
system such as the Confluence based one is not ideal for a few reasons.
Ideally we should have an SVN based CMS that would allow a user to edit
content online and automate the workflow of submitting the patch. In
principle there is consensus that moving to an SVN based system is the
right thing to do. The question is when to make the change. Should we
implement it now, or wait for the availability of a better CMS?
