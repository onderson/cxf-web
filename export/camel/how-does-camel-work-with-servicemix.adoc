How does Camel work with ServiceMix?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Camel to do smart routing and implement the
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] inside of the JBI container, routing between existing JBI
components together with communicating with any of the other Camel
link:components.html[Components].

To do this you take your Camel link:spring.html[Spring] configuration
and turn it into a JBI Service Unit using the maven plugin or archetype.

Camel plugin].
