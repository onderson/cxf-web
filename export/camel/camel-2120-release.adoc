[[Camel2.12.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.12.0 release which approx XXX issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* link:endpoint-annotations.html[Endpoint Annotations] along with
automatically created HTML documentation for the endpoint parameters;
this makes it easier for component developers to add a few
refactoring-safe annotations to their Endpoint or Consumer
implementations and, (along with javadoc comments on the field or setter
method), get nice user documentation on how to use the endpoint for
free.
* link:componentconfiguration.html[ComponentConfiguration] API provides
a handy API for tools developers to introspect on a Component to find
all the possible parameters, their types and any extra annotations (like
Bean Validation Annotations) to be able to create/edit endpoints or URI
strings so that tools can generate nicer UIs for configuring endpoints
than just letting folks edit Strings.
* link:endpointcompleter.html[EndpointCompleter] API provides a hook so
that command line tools (like
http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest-2.3.x/users-guide/using-console.html[Karaf's
shell]), IDEs and web tools can get (bash tab like) auto-completion on
endpoint paths (such as file or directory names, message queue names,
database table names) when creating or using new endpoints
* Reduced stack-frames in use during routing, that also makes Camel's
stack traces being logged much less verbose. This also allows people to
easier debug the internals of Camel as less `AsyncCallback` callbacks
are in use during routing.
* Easy to use link:message-history.html[Message History] out of the box.
And included message history as "route stack-trace" when exceptions
logged by link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] to make it easier for
end users to spot where the exception occurred.
* link:spring-web-services.html[Spring Web Services] now supports
setting/receiving SOAP headers more easily using a header on the Camel
link:message.html[Message].
* Evaluating link:groovy.html[Groovy] expressions is faster as we cache
the compiled scripts.
* Added `base64` option to link:shiro-security.html[Shiro Security] to
allow transferring security token over link:jms.html[JMS] and other
transports as base64 encoded representation.
* Made it easier to use link:shiro-security.html[Shiro Security] as the
credentials can be provided in headers, when sending a message to a
secured route.
* link:bindy.html[Bindy] now supports enums.
* Added new link:backlogdebugger.html[BacklogDebugger] to perform live
debugging of messages during routing. The
link:backlogdebugger.html[BacklogDebugger] has JMX API allows tooling to
control the debugger.
* While using the http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/jackson[Jackson
library] through the link:json.html[JSON] Dataformat there's now a
`jsonView` attribute you could make use of directly inside the
link:dsl.html[DSL] itself.
* link:smpp.html[SMPP] now supports optional parameters in all commands
where they are possible.
* link:jdbc.html[JDBC] now supports named parameters.
* Added timeout support for link:direct.html[Direct] producers to wait
for consumer to become active.
* Added `stats` action to link:controlbus.html[ControlBus] to easily get
performance statics in a single XML message.
* Added support for request timeout on link:netty.html[Netty] producer,
and to configure logging level on link:netty.html[Netty] consumer to be
less noisy for ChannelClosedException which can flood the logs when
client disconnects abruptly.
* link:springbatch.html[Spring Batch] component producer now returns the
`JobExecution` instance as the output message. Users can use the
`JobExecution` instance to perform some operations using the Spring
Batch API directly.
* Added support for NULL values in link:sql-component.html[SQL] with
named parameters.
* Optimized link:jetty.html[Jetty] streaming responses in non-chunked
mode; and as well using buffer sizes based on
`HttpServletResponse.getBufferSize()` instead of fixed size of 4kb.
* Added `greedy` option to link:polling-consumer.html[scheduled polling
consumer].
* Added support for accessing the length field on Java arrays in
link:simple.html[Simple] language.
* Added support for using JAXB annotations with Camel's Jackson
link:json.html[JSON] component.
* Added the ability for link:bindy.html[Bindy] to skip content when
parsing fixed-length records.
* link:mongodb.html[MongoDB] now supports aggregation queries.
* link:netty.html[Netty] allows to use shared Netty boss and worker
thread pools.
* The link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel Maven Archetypes] for
component and data format now packages as OSGi bundles out of the box.
* Easier link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] configuration using
`StreamCachingStrategy`. Also allows spool directory per
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] instead of shared per JVM. And
insight at runtime using JMX management. As well allowing to plugin 3rd
party implementations.
* Improved link:netty.html[Netty] to be able to join an UDP multicast
group.
* Using Camel link:spring.html[Spring] is now setting up Camel routes
later in the process allow Spring to complete all of its dependency
injection, before Camel `RouteBuilder` instances is configured. This
allows to safely use Spring dependency injection in these `RouteBuilder`
classes.
* Services in a link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] which can only be
enlisted once (eg it similar to a static in a JVM) has simpler and fixed
MBean names in JMX.
* link:sql-component.html[JDBC based aggregation repository] for the
link:aggregator2.html[Aggregate] EIP now supports optimistic locking,
allows clustered Camel applications to use a shared database for the
aggregation repository.
* link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] stores a property
(`Exchange.RECIPIENT_LIST_ENDPOINT`) on the link:exchange.html[Exchange]
with the link:uris.html[URIs] of the link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] the
message was sent to.
* Added `mask` option to link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] to hide
sensitive information such as passwords.
* Added `outputType` option supporting `SelectList`, and `SelectOne` to
link:sql-component.html[SQL Component] to dictate the output message
body type when doing SQL SELECT queries.
* link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer]s such as
link:file2.html[File], and link:ftp2.html[FTP] now supports using custom
scheduler. Providing a new link:quartz2.html[Quartz2], and
link:spring.html[Spring] based out of the box, that allows to use CRON
based scheduler.
* link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer]s such as
link:file2.html[File], and link:ftp2.html[FTP] now supports _backoff_,
to let the consumer be less aggressive, when there has been no messages
to poll, or errors keeps occurring for a while.
* Added support for XML Encryption 1.1 algorithms in the
link:xmlsecurity-dataformat.html[XMLSecurity data format]. It is now
possible to specify stronger digest algorithms when using RSA OAEP Key
Transport algorithms.
* link:netty.html[Netty] consumer now unbinds/binds the acceptor when
the route is suspended/resumed.
* link:eip.html[EIP]s supporting `AggregationStrategy` such as
link:aggregator2.html[Aggregate], link:splitter.html[Splitter],
link:content-enricher.html[Content Enricher] now supports using a POJO
as the `AggregationStrategy`, which allows to implement the aggregate
logic with no Camel API dependency. See more details at the
link:aggregator2.html[Aggregate] page.
* `camel-jpa` upgraded to use native JPA API instead of Springs
deprecated JpaTemplate
* Improved validation of routes being misconfigured on startup, when
using `onException`, `onCompletion`, `transacted`, etc. as they must be
configured as top-level on the route (eg in the start), and not later
(such as nested in a link:splitter.html[Splitter]).
* Added new @PropertyInject annotation to inject
link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[property placeholders] to POJOs
* New class `org.apache.camel.util.toolbox.AggregationStrategies` as a
starting point to obtain commonly used Aggregation Strategies for
Multicast, Splitter, Aggregator, etc. EIPs.
* New `FlexibleAggregationStrategy` serving as a one-stop to perform
typical aggregation strategy logic out-of-the-box: filtering results,
storing them in properties, headers or bodies, as a list, casting
results, etc.
* Improved performance when doing link:bean.html[Bean] method calls
using link:simple.html[Simple] OGNL calls
* Improved link:dozer-type-conversion.html[Dozer Type Conversion] to
work better with OSGi Blueprint (though Dozer 5.5 may be required to
work even better)
* link:jms.html[JMS] now also enlists topic destinations as managed
endpoints in link:camel-jmx.html[JMX]
* link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful Shutdown] now allows to suppress
logging after `CamelContext` has been stopped, due to a timeout hit, and
there may still be inflight link:exchange.html[Exchange]s that may
afterwards be rejected being executed and causing WARN logs; which now
can be suppressed.
* Made it easy to add custom services on startup when testing with
link:blueprint-testing.html[Blueprint Testing].
* XML Signature support via the link:xml-security-component.html[XML
Security component].

[[Camel2.12.0Release-FixedIssues]]
Fixed Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed setting .id in Java DSL on some link:eip.html[EIP]s such as the
link:validate.html[Validate]
* Fixed link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] always
handled exception, which wasn't the case if an
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] was in use, which didn't
had handled=true.
* Fixed link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Using PropertyPlaceholder]
in attributes defined on `<camelContext>`.
* All Camel link:components.html[Components] will configure their
consumers when being created to ensure you can configure from
link:uris.html[URIs] with `consumer.` as prefix.
* Fixed link:quickfix.html[QuickfixJEndpoint] to adhere a given InOut
MEP correctly.
* Fixed using property placeholders in a link:simple.html[Simple]
predicate used inside a when in a link:content-based-router.html[Content
Based Router] when using link:java-dsl.html[Java DSL]
* Fixed a race condition in link:file2.html[File] consumer which may
lead to a tiny window for another process to pickup a file, as the read
lock is committed before the file is moved afterwards etc. Now read
locks is executed last.
* link:http4.html[HTTP4] now validates that only one instance of
`org.apache.camel.util.jsse.SSLContextParameters` is used per component,
as multiple is not supported, and could lead to undesired side effects.
* Fixed possible dead-lock during link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful
Shutdown] if a route starts from link:seda.html[SEDA] and uses
link:splitter.html[Splitter] or link:multicast.html[Multicast] and
maximumRedeliveries was enabled as well.
* Fixed link:splitter.html[TokenizeXML] to support self closing tags.
* Fixed link:blueprint-testing.html[Blueprint Testing] to work with
`isMockEndpointsAndSkip` and other similar functionality of the
`CamelBlueprintTestSupport` class.

link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip], and
link:dynamic-router.html[Dynamic Router] EIPs to work with
link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching]
* Fixed suspending/resuming Camel link:quartz.html[Quartz] routes
* Fixed link:sql-component.html[SQL Component] using queries with a
single parameter and the data is JSON like structure (having comma
separators)
* Fixed link:jetty.html[Jetty] to be able to use stream cached streams
that was spooled to disk, as its reply message when sending back reply
to the caller.
* Fixed `endChoice()` in Java DSL to work when being nested in parent
link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router](s)
* Fixed link:lucene.html[Lucene] to reuse existing index directory if
Camel is being restarted etc.
* Fixed using <routeContextRef> to not share the routes when using
multiple <camelContext>, but each <camelContext> have their own route
instances to not cause side-effects between the
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext]s.
* Fixed using type converter from `NodeList` -> `Node`
* Fixed having 2+ routes from the *same* JMS queue, not stop the
endpoint if there are still active listeners when a route is stopped.
* Fixed link:seda.html[SEDA] when using `queueSize` not able to identify
its same queue size, when using multiple link:seda.html[SEDA] endpoints
for the same queue name/size.
* Fixed using `<routeBuilder ref="name"/>` in OSGi Blueprint when
referring to a `RouteBuilder` from another bundle, exposed in the OSGi
service registry.
* Fixed OSGi Blueprint in some situations causing a
`CircularDependencyException` when using Camel namespaces outside a
`<camelContext>`, being referred from inside the `<camelContext>`.
* Fixed link:http4.html[HTTP4] in bridge mode to not store cookies,
which otherwise would eat up memory.

[[Camel2.12.0Release-Internalchanges]]
Internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The following classes in `org.apache.camel.processor` has been removed
as they are no longer needed due internal optimization:
`UnitOfWorkProcessor`, `ChildUnitOfWorkProcessor`,
`RouteContextProcessor`, `RouteInflightRepositoryProcessor`, and
`RoutePolicyProcessor`

[[Camel2.12.0Release-Changesthatmayaffectendusers]]
Changes that may affect end users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumers when using
idempotent repository will no longer invoke `contains` with a directory
name; this has been changed to only be checked for files.
* Shutting down using link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful Shutdown] now
requires the timeout value to be positive. And improved logic to avoid
getting stuck in waiting for inflight messages, and having counter go
negative.
* link:tracer.html[Tracer] now requires explicitly to be enabled on
`CamelContext` to be available and in use.
* The class
`org.apache.camel.processor.interceptor.BacklogTracerInterceptor` has
been removed as it was no longer needed due internal optimizations.
* The link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] default threshold for
spooling to disk has been changed from 64kb to 128kb.
* The unary operators in link:simple.html[Simple] is now only applied on
functions
* Using Camel link:spring.html[Spring] is now setting up Camel routes
later in the process allow Spring to complete all of its dependency
injection, before Camel `RouteBuilder` instances is configured. This
allows to safely use Spring dependency injection in these `RouteBuilder`
classes.
* Changing destination using JMX on
`org.apache.camel.api.management.mbean.ManagedSendProcessorMBean` no
longer supported.
* Camel now uses `xxxxxx` instead of `******` when masking passwords
(sanitize) when logging link:uris.html[URIs] in the log. Using `xxxxx`
is more friendly with JMX naming.
* The `DefaultProducer` now delegates to the `Endpoint` in the
`isSingleton()` method call, to use the same value as its endpoint.
* Requests that use RSA v1.5 as the key transport algorithm will be
rejected in the camel-xmlsecurity component, unless this algorithm has
been explicitly configured.
* The link:camel-maven-plugin.html[Camel Maven Plugin] now uses
"compile+runtime" as scope for required dependencies added to the
classpath when running the plugin. This ensures also dependencies with
provided scope gets included.
* The `userConfigURL` option from link:fop.html[FOP] now loads the
resource from classpath by default.

[[Camel2.12.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Spring 3.0.x is no longer supported.
* The usage of the deprecated built-in `CommonsHttpMessageSender` has
been replaced with `HttpUrlConnectionMessageSender` by
link:spring-web-services.html[Spring Web Services]. Consider this in
case either the `timeout` or `sslContextParameters` option is used
through the Producer of this component.
* `camel-scala-29` module has been removed.
