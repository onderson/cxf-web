Normalizer
^^^^^^^^^^

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Normalizer.html[Normalizer]
from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns] by
using a link:message-router.html[Message Router] in front of a number of
link:message-translator.html[Message Translator] instances.

[[Normalizer-Example]]
Example
+++++++

This example shows a Message Normalizer that converts two types of XML
messages into a common format. Messages in this common format are then
filtered.

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

\{snippet:id=example|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/NormalizerTest.java}

In this case we're using a Java bean as the normalizer. The class looks
like this

\{snippet:id=example|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/MyNormalizer.java}

*Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]*

The same example in the Spring DSL

\{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/normalizer.xml}
