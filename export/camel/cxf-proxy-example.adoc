CXF Proxy Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example is located in the `examples/camel-example-cxf-proxy`
directory of the Camel distribution. +
There is a `README.txt` file with instructions how to run it.

If you use Maven then you can easily run it from the command line using:

mvn camel:run

[[CXFProxyExample-About]]
About
^^^^^

This example demonstrates how link:cxf.html[CXF] can be used to proxy a
real web service. For this example we want Camel to validate and enrich
the input message before it's sent to the actual web service. We do this
to ensure the data is correct and to have Camel automatically add in any
missing information. In real life you may wish to use a proxy in cases
where clients are sending bad/faulty data to a web service, and it's
costly/not possible to update and fix those clients.

Pure HTTP proxy

If you want a pure HTTP-based proxy then you can use
link:jetty.html[Jetty] or link:servlet.html[Servlet] as the front end in
Camel. Then delegate those incoming HTTP requests to the real web
service. This is for cases where you need a simple straight through
proxy where the message should not be altered by Camel. By using the
link:cxf.html[CXF] component you get access to all the web service
features Apache CXF provides, whereas link:jetty.html[Jetty] will
provide just a pure HTTP proxy.

[[CXFProxyExample-Implementation]]
Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this simple example both the Camel application and the real web
service are in the same JVM. In production work the real web service may
often be hosted on another server, etc.

[[CXFProxyExample-SpringXML]]
Spring XML
++++++++++

In the Spring XML file we have defined the link:cxf.html[CXF] proxy
endpoint using the `<cxf:cxfEndpoint>` tag. The real web service is the
Spring bean with the id `realWebService`.

As you can see in the Camel route we use a link:cxf.html[CXF] consumer
to proxy the web service. Then we route the message to the EnrichBean
which validates and adds the missing information. Then we just use the
link:http.html[HTTP] component to send the web service request to the
real web service. +
The reply from the real web service is then logged and used as a reply
for the proxied web service as well.

[[CXFProxyExample-Enrichbean]]
Enrich bean
+++++++++++

The enrich bean is Java code which in our simple example will just set
the incidentId parameter to the fixed value of 456. In your
implementation you can of course do a lot more.

[[CXFProxyExample-Runningtheexample]]
Running the example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You start the example from the command line using the Maven goal
`mvn camel:run`. +
You can also start the Camel application from your IDE, by running the
`org.apache.camel.example.cxf.proxy.MyMain` main class.

You can then use SoapUI or another web service client and send a request
to the
`http://localhost:9080/camel-example-cxf-proxy/webservices/incident`
url. The wsdl is located at:
`http://localhost:9080/camel-example-cxf-proxy/webservices/incident?wsdl`.

After making a SOAP request, check the console to see the SOAP request
and response:
