Detour
^^^^^^

The http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/Detour.html[Detour]
from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns] allows
you to send messages through additional steps if a control condition is
met. It can be useful for turning on extra validation, testing,
debugging code when needed.

[[Detour-Example]]
Example
+++++++

In this example we essentially have a route like
`from("direct:start").to("mock:result")` with a conditional detour to
the `mock:detour` endpoint in the middle of the route..

*Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
    <choice>
      <when>
        <method bean="controlBean" method="isDetour"/>
    <to uri="mock:detour"/>
      </when>
    </choice>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
</route>
----

whether the detour is turned on or off is decided by the `ControlBean`.
So, when the detour is on the message is routed to `mock:detour` and
then `mock:result`. When the detour is off, the message is routed to
`mock:result`.

[[Detour-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
