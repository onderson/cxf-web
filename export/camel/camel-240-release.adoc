[[Camel2.4.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.4.0 release which approx 182 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Spring 3.0.3 is now the default Spring version used by Camel.
* Fully non blocking link:asynchronous-routing-engine.html[Asynchronous
Routing Engine] which all link:eip.html[EIP]s and some Camel
link:components.html[Components] supported.
* New feature to use scheduled link:exception-clause.html[delayed
redelivery attempts] (they are fully asynchronous and non blocking). You
need to enable this using the option `asyncDelayedRedelivery`.
* Fixed a potential dead-lock when using
link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] with timeout completion set.
* The *camel-spring* module now supports OSGi out of box, which renders
*camel-osgi* as *@deprecated*.
* link:using-osgi-blueprint-with-camel.html[OSGi blueprint] is now
supported
* Added new link:spring.html[`<contextScan>`] to scan the
link:registry.html[Registry] for `RouteBuilder` instances, just as
scanning the classpath etc.
* Manually started routes is now also
link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful Shutdown] by Camel
* Fixed issue using link:configuring-camel.html[RouteContextRef] with
multiple link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] from the same Spring
ApplicationContext.
* link:bindy.html[Bindy] now supports Fixed-Length format message with
padding, alignment (Left or Right)
* Improved and fixes some issues with the link:ftp2.html[FTP] component.
* Improved and fixed some issues using `MultiPartForm` with
link:jetty.html[Jetty].
* Add ability to configure link:bindy.html[Bindy] to remove whitespace
when binding `Numeric` positions
* Added option `useOriginalBody` to link:oncompletion.html[OnCompletion]
* Fixed issue when using mockito for testing when it uses CGLib proxies
* Fixed issue with `@Consume` not running in an unit of work to ensure
callbacks is invoked when its done
* link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip] now uses
link:expression.html[Expression] to define the slip. This is similar to
the link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] pattern
* The security context can be passed from link:cxf.html[CXF] to other
camel link:components.html[Components].
* `ManagementAgent` settings can now be set using setters from Java,
instead of having to use JVM system properties. See tip in
link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] wiki page.
* link:resequencer.html[Resequencer] in batch mode has two new options
`allowDuplicates` and `reverse` which allows you to use it for
re-ordering messages from link:jms.html[JMS] queues based on
`JMSPriority`
* Tighten up the `ProducerTemplate` API a bit, see more details in the
section _Important changes to consider when upgrading_.
* link:http.html[HTTP] now better supports sending binary files.
* Fixed problem with using link:quartz.html[Quartz] in OSGi and having
Camel applications being hot-deployed which potentially could cause
link:quartz.html[Quartz] to stop scheduling in applications which
haven't been stopped.
* Fixed issue with pausing and resuming jobs when running
link:quartz.html[Quartz] in clustered mode
* Added options on link:quartz.html[Quartz] component to specify
location of custom `quartz.properties` file to load from classpath.
* Upgraded to latest link:quartz.html[Quartz] release 1.8.3.
* Introduced `StartupListener` to allow
components/endpoints/producers/consumers etc. as a listener to be
notified when `CamelContext` have just been started. This allows any
custom logic to be executed as a late starter. This ensures
link:quartz.html[Quartz] scheduler is only started when all the routes
and so forth is started and running.
* Fixed issue with link:ftp2.html[FTP] configuring starting directory
from uri not accepting an absolute path. In the endpoint uri just define
two leading / to indicate absolute, eg
`"ftp:admin:secret@someserver//absolutepath/foo/bar"`.
* Added `fromRoute` to link:notifybuilder.html[NotifyBuilder].
* Improved the link:csv.html[CSV] component.
* Fixed issue with link:direct.html[Direct] endpoint having no consumers
if endpoint have been evicted from `CamelContext` internal LRUCache.
* The link:routebuilder.html[RouteBuilder] now have `simple` and `xpath`
expression builder methods out of the box.
* Upgraded to latest release of Scala 2.8.0RC7 in
link:scala-dsl.html[Scala DSL]
* link:hawtdb.html[camel-hawtdb] updated to
http://github.com/chirino/hawtdb/tree/hawtdb-1.1[HawtDB 1.1] picks up
several bug fixes that improves stability and performance.
* Fixed issue with link:splitter.html[splitting] link:file2.html[file]s
using `tokenizer` not being able to delete/move file after processing is
done on Windows platform.
* `maxMessagesPerPoll` is now applied eagerly to limit intaking files
earlier for the link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP]
components, Thus avoid excessive memory consumption if you poll
directories which contains 100.000+ files.
* Added `connectTimeout`, `soTimeout` and `timeout` to
link:ftp2.html[FTP] so its easier to configure timeouts.
* Consolidated support for per platform disabling of tests across the
entire test suite.
* Introduced link:processorfactory.html[ProcessorFactory] to be able to
use a custom factory to be able to manipulate
link:processor.html[Processor] creation process. For example to add
additional outputs or manipulate the route model.
* link:jms.html[camel-jms] now supports Oracle AQ
* Added a link:camel-2x-debugger-api.html[Debugger] API to be leveraged
by 3rd party tooling.
* The `beanRef` and `methodCall` DSLs will eager check on startup, the
bean reference exists in link:registry.html[Registry] and the provided
method name is a valid method name on the bean as well. This helps to
fail fast if end users have a typo in their routes.
* link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] now exposes notifications which listeners can
receive.
* Added `ExchangeRedeliveryEvent` event being emitted when Camel
link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] attempts a redelivery.
* link:properties.html[Properties] component can lookup
`java.util.Properties` from the link:registry.html[Registry] using the
`ref:` prefix.
* link:spring-security.html[Spring Security] is upgrade to spring
security 3.0.3.RELEASE.

[[Camel2.4.0Release-APIbreaking]]
API breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The link:toasync.html[ToAsync] has been removed and replaced with a
better link:asynchronous-processing.html[asynchronous routing engine].

link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip] now requires using
link:expression.html[Expression] to specify the routing slip header, the
XML DSL of link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip] is broken.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <route>
       <from uri="direct:a"/>
       <!--NOTE from Camel 2.4.0, you need to specify the expression element inside of the routingSlip element -->
       <routingSlip ignoreInvalidEndpoints="true">
           <header>myHeader</header>
       </routingSlip>
    </route>
----

The `retryUntil` method on link:exception-clause.html[onException] have
been renamed to `retryWhile` to better match what it does. It keeps
retrying while the predicate returns `true`.

`org.apache.camel.spi.Policy` now has an additional method `beforeWrap`
which means you need to implement this method in your implementations.
Just add a empty method to adapt.

The class `org.apache.camel.management.event.ExchangeFailureEvent` has
been renamed to `org.apache.camel.management.event.ExchangeFailedEvent`.

[[Camel2.4.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The link:tracer.html[Tracer] may not output all details for some
situations such as when using `onCompletion` or `intercept` etc.

Not all link:examples.html[Examples] have ANT build.xml files to run the
example using ANT.

The read `timeout` in link:netty.html[Netty] is causing it to spawn
threads and you end up with out of memory error. You have to disable
using timeout by setting the `timeout=0` in the endpoint configuration.
This issue has been fixed in the next release.

The link:error-handler.html[LoggingErrorHandler] does not work when also
using link:exception-clause.html[onException]. It may go into an endless
loop. So refrain from using logging error handler.

The link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] statistics for `type=processors` is being
counted double. The stats on the `type=routes` is correct though.

The link:jetty.html[Jetty] component sends back HTTP headers with
lower-case keys.

link:hawtdb.html[HawtDB] does not work in OSGi

link:hawtdb.html[HawtDB] has a bug in version 1.4 or older which
prevents the filestore to free unused space. Version 1.5 fixes this.

There is a concurrency issue when using predicates using binary
operators such as `isEqualTo`. See
https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-3188[CAMEL-3188].

The link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumer may stop continue polling. You can
start the consumer from eg. a management console and it will start
again.

[[Camel2.4.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Camel now uses Spring 3.0.3 as the default Spring version. Spring 2.5 is
still supported. +
Spring 2.0.x support is now *@deprecated* and will in future releases
*not* be supported.

[Warning]
====
 **Spring 3.0 dependency injection changed**

Mind that Spring 3.0 has changed how it performs dependency injection.
In fact it may even perform this differently than what Spring 2.5 would
do. For example the order and which beans is dependency injected on
startup could potential affect your existing Camel applications when
upgrading. It appears as Spring 3.0 has gotten worse in this area and
you may have to specify `depends-on` attributes on your spring `bean` to
help Spring.

====

`IntrospectionSupport` has been improved to be consistent for
`getProperty` and `getProperties`. Also `getProperties` now find all
relevant properties. This will often only be relevant for Camel end
users who build their own components any may use `IntrospectionSupport`.

The `ProducerTemplate` have been tighten up a bit. All
`send/request -body` methods will now throw a `CamelExecutionException`
with the cause wrapped. This ensures its consistent.

The link:ftp2.html[`ftps`] is now using secure data channel also when
transferring files. There has been added some options which you can use
to control the behavior and turn it off if you want the old behavior
(only secure login).

The link:ftp2.html[FTP] starting directory can now be set using absolute
paths as well. In the endpoint uri just define two leading / to indicate
absolute, eg `"ftp:admin:secret@someserver//absolutepath/foo/bar"`.

The default port from link:ftp2.html[`ftps`] has been changed from 2222
to 21.

The link:ftp2.html[FTP] is now using a default of 10 sec connect timeout
(ALL), and 30 sec data timeout (FTP/FTPS only).

The link:routebuilder.html[RouteBuilder] now have `simple` and `xpath`
expression builder methods out of the box, which means you don't have to
use static imports to use those two link:languages.html[Languages]. The
compiler may complain if you have a static import, which you simply fix
by removing the static import.
