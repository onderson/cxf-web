Routes
~~~~~~

Camel supports the definition of routing rules using a Java
link:dsl.html[DSL] (domain specific language) which avoids the need for
cumbersome XML using a link:routebuilder.html[RouteBuilder].

For example a simple route can be created as follows.

As you can see from the above Camel uses link:uris.html[URIs] to wire
endpoints together.

[[Routes-URIStringformatting]]
URI String formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.0*

If you have endpoint URIs that accept options and you want to be able to
substitute the value, e.g. build the URI by concat the strings together,
then you can use the `java.lang.String.format` method. But in Camel 2.0
we have added two convenient methods in the Java DSL so you can do
`fromF` and `toF` that uses String formatting to build the URI.

[[Routes-Filters]]
Filters
^^^^^^^

You can combine simple routes with filters which can be arbitrary
link:predicate.html[Predicate] implementations.

[[Routes-Choices]]
Choices
^^^^^^^

With a choice you provide a list of predicates and outcomes along with
an optional default otherwise clause which is invoked if none of the
conditions are met.

[[Routes-Usingacustomprocessor]]
Using a custom processor
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here is an example of using a custom link:processor.html[Processor]

You can mix and match custom processors with filters and choices.
