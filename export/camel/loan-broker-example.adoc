Loan Broker Example
-------------------

This example shows how to use Camel to implement the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ComposedMessagingExample.html[EIP's
loan broker example].

The example has two versions,one for JMS, one for webservice one. +
The JMS version which leverages the message queue to connect the credit
agency and bank loan quote processors together, it just uses the InOnly
exchange pattern to handle the message asynchronously; +
the webservice version which shows how to integrate the credit agency
and bank web services together by using the InOut exchange pattern
synchronously.

[[LoanBrokerExample-Examplewithwebservice]]
Example with web service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-loan-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/loanbroker/webservice/version/[web
service version of loan broker] is based on the camel-cxf component
which can produce and consume the SOAP message on the wire. It uses the
InOut Message exchange pattern, when the client send out the message to
the router , it can get the response message back from the same
endpoint. +
When we send out the quote message to the three different banks, we
could choice to call the bank service one by one or send out the message
parallelly(one request thread per request). +
You can compare the response time after you run the sample.
