[[Camel2.21.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the x.y.z release which approx XXX issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Upgraded to JAXB 2.3.0 which is more JDK9 compliant.
* Added better support for `javax.jms.StreamMessage` types
in link:jms.html[JMS] component.
* Optimised link:jms.html[JMS] to support ActiveMQ Artemis
http://activemq.apache.org/artemis/docs/latest/large-messages.html[large
messages] so you can send and receive big messages such as GB's in size.
There is an example demonstrating this in
camel-example-artemis-large-messages.
* Added support for route coverage reports which allows 3rd party
tooling via SPI to visualise route coverage to Camel developers.
* Added route-coverage goal to the
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/tooling/maven/camel-maven-plugin/src/main/docs/camel-maven-plugin.adoc[Camel
Maven Plugin] so you can report route coverage from Maven command line.
* Added support for doing manual commits via Java code when using
link:kafka.html[Kafka] consumer.
* Vendor extensions in the swagger generated API docs is now disabled
turned off, when using link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL] (not all 3rd
party API gateways/tooling support vendor extensions). You can turn this
back-on via the apiVendorExtension option.
* The SFTP consumer now also supports the `useList` option which can be
used to download a single known file without use LIST operation on the
FTP server (which can be slow if the FTP server has many files in the
LIST results)
* Camel link:json.html[JSON] with camel-jackson will now automatic use
shared ObjectMapper instance if there is only one instance in
the link:registry.html[Registry]. For example users with Spring Boot
then allows Camel to easily use the default mapper from Spring Boot.
* Added `ExtendedStartupListener` that allows a callback just after the
CamelContext has been fully started.
* You can now specify examples in the link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL] that
are included in the generated Swagger api-doc via camel-swagger-java.
* Improved file/ftp consumer to use current thread to poll, instead of a
scheduled background task, when using pollEnrich
(link:content-enricher.html[Content Enricher]).
* link:direct.html[Direct] component now blocks by default if sending to
a consumer which is not yet ready, which may happen during startup
(little window of opportunity). This
avoids `DirectConsumerNotAvailableException` being thrown during startup
etc.
* The link:ftp.html[FTP] component can now log progress (turn
on transferLoggingLevel) when perfomring download/upload and other
operations. You can also find this information for the consumer in JMX. 
* Added support for resuming downloads to link:ftp.html[FTP] component.
For example if you download big files and has connection problems with
the FTP server. Then later when the connectivity works again, Camel can
resume download the in-progress file.
* The link:jetty.html[Jetty] and link:servlet.html[SERVLET] consumers
will now return HTTP Status 405 (method not allowed) for requests that
would have been processed by another HTTP request method, for example
calling REST services with the wrong method. Beforehand a 404 error code
was always regardless.
* Reworked the `FileIdempotentRepository` so the internal in-memory
cache is only used for quick lookup of the most frequent file names, and
lookup from disk as well. See more details in the class javadoc of the
file.

The following issues has been fixed

* Fixed afterApplicationStart callback on camel-spring-boot to be called
later and after CamelContext has been fully started.
* Fixed an issue testing with @UseAdviceWith and Camel on Spring Boot.
* Fixed link:oncompletion.html[OnCompletion] would not be triggered from
a route using link:splitter.html[Splitter] and an exception was thrown
during splitting.
* Fixed link:kafka.html[Kafka] consumer stops consuming messages when
exception occurs during offset commit.
* Fixed link:netty4.html[Netty4] consumer to stop taking in new requests
while being shutdown, as otherwise it cannot graceful shutdown if new
requests come in faster than it can process existing in-flight messages.
* Fixed an issue with link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip]
and link:dynamic-router.html[Dynamic Router] when using context scoped
error handler, could cause the error handler to become stopped.
* Fixed link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL] with link:jetty.html[Jetty]
security via custom define security handler and turned on api-doc as
well would not startup Jetty server due missing NoLoginService error.

[[Camel2.21.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Jetty has been upgraded to 9.4 by default, and camel-jetty is requring
version 9.3 or 9.4 to run in OSGi.
* link:direct.html[Direct] component now blocks by default if sending to
a consumer which is not yet ready, which may happen during startup
(little window of opportunity). This
avoids `DirectConsumerNotAvailableException` being thrown during startup
etc. The old beavhaior can be turned on by setting `block=false` on the
direct component level, or on endpoints where needed.
* When using `camel-saxon` then the SaxonXpathFactory class is created
in the
https://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/xpath-api/jaxp-xpath/factory.html[recommended
way] from Saxon. It will fallback and create the factory the old way if
not possible.
* The `camel-json-validator` component has switched from using Everit to
NetworkNT JSon Schema validator library, as the former had ASF license
implications and would not be allowed in future Camel releases. The
NetworkNT supports v4 draft of JSon Schema as validation so make sure to
use that draft version in your schemas.
* Reworked the `FileIdempotentRepository` so the internal in-memory
cache is only used for quick lookup of the most frequent file names, and
lookup from disk as well. See more details in the class javadoc of the
file.
* The link:karaf.html[Karaf] commands for routes is changed so the
arguments for the camel context is first, and the route id is the 2nd
argument. This allows the route completer to use the selected camel
context name to only show route ids from that camel context, as
otherwise it shows all the routes for every Camel application running in
Karaf.
