guice:embedded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *guice:embedded* goal of the link:guice-maven-plugin.html[Guice
Maven Plugin] is used to run your Camel link:guice.html[Guice]
configurations in the same JVM as Maven, so it should startup a bit
faster than link:guice-run-maven-goal.html[guice:run]. Though sometimes
we all get the odd classpath issue; so sometimes forking a new JVM can
work around any strange Maven classpath issues.

A good example application to get you started is the
link:guice-jms-example.html[Guice JMS Example].
