We keep the documentation in the source code in the javadoc for the +
setter methods on the component and endpoint classes. +
 +
We use this to generate and keep documentation up to date. Though this +
is not yet complete and work in progress. But eventually the Camel +
documentation on the website will be generated from this that ensures +
the doc is always up to date with the actual source code. +
 +
So you may want to submit PRs to fix those docs in the source code as
well. +
 +
You can see the generated docs in some of the components such as +
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-ahc/src/main/docs/ahc-component.adoc +
 +
eg the components that have a ascii doc file. +
 +
So if you look in that adoc file you can see +
 +
// component options: START +
// component options: END

// endpoint options: START +
// endpoint options: END

  +
then when building the source code, then the options within that +
comment section is generated from the source code. So just change the +
docs in the source and the adoc is updated. +
 +
