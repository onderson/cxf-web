To support flexible and powerful
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] Camel supports various Languages to create an
link:expression.html[Expression] or link:predicate.html[Predicate]

link:xml-configuration.html[Xml Configuration].

**Combining Predicates**

When creating predicates (expressions that evaluate to `true` or
`false`), you can combine several predicates - regardless of the
language they are built with - by using the PredicateBuilder class. For
