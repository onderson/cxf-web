Apache Camel ™ is a versatile open-source integration framework based on
known link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns].

Camel empowers you to define routing and mediation rules in a variety of
domain-specific languages, including a Java-based link:dsl.html[Fluent
API], link:spring.html[Spring] or
link:using-osgi-blueprint-with-camel.html[Blueprint]
link:xml-configuration.html[XML Configuration] files, and a
link:scala-dsl.html[Scala DSL]. This means you get smart completion of
routing rules in your IDE, whether in a Java, Scala or XML editor.

Apache Camel uses link:uris.html[URIs] to work directly with any kind of
link:transport.html[Transport] or messaging model such as
link:http.html[HTTP], link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ], link:jms.html[JMS],
link:jbi.html[JBI], SCA, link:mina.html[MINA] or link:cxf.html[CXF], as
well as pluggable link:components.html[Components] and
link:data-format.html[Data Format] options. Apache Camel is a small
library with minimal link:what-are-the-dependencies.html[dependencies]
for easy embedding in any Java application. Apache Camel lets you work
with the same link:exchange.html[API] regardless which kind of
link:transport.html[Transport] is used - so learn the API once and you
can interact with all the link:components.html[Components] provided
out-of-box.

Apache Camel provides support for link:bean-binding.html[Bean Binding]
and seamless integration with popular frameworks such as
link:cdi.html[CDI], link:spring.html[Spring],
link:using-osgi-blueprint-with-camel.html[Blueprint] and
link:guice.html[Guice]. Camel also has extensive support for
link:testing.html[unit testing] your routes.

The following projects can leverage Apache Camel as a routing and
mediation engine:

* http://servicemix.apache.org/[Apache ServiceMix] - a popular
distributed open source ESB and JBI container
* http://activemq.apache.org/[Apache ActiveMQ] - a mature, widely used
open source message broker
* http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] - a smart web services suite
(JAX-WS and JAX-RS)
* http://karaf.apache.org/[Apache Karaf] - a small OSGi based runtime in
which applications can be deployed
* http://mina.apache.org/[Apache MINA] - a high-performance
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_I/O[NIO]-driven networking framework

So don't get the hump - try Camel today!
