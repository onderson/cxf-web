Scatter-Gather
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/BroadcastAggregate.html[Scatter-Gather]
from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns] allows
you to route messages to a number of dynamically specified recipients
and re-aggregate the responses back into a single message.

Dynamic Scatter-Gather Example
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this example we want to get the best quote for beer from several
different vendors. We use a dynamic link:recipient-list.html[Recipient
List] to get the request for a quote to all vendors and an
link:aggregator.html[Aggregator] to pick the best quote out of all the
responses. The routes for this are defined as:

So in the first route you see that the
link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] is looking at the
`listOfVendors` header for the list of recipients. So, we need to send a
message like

This message will be distributed to the following
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint]s: `bean:vendor1`, `bean:vendor2`, and
`bean:vendor3`. These are all beans which look like

and are loaded up in Spring like

Each bean is loaded with a different price for beer. When the message is
sent to each bean endpoint, it will arrive at the `MyVendor.getQuote`
method. This method does a simple check whether this quote request is
for beer and then sets the price of beer on the exchange for retrieval
at a later step. The message is forwarded on to the next step using
link:pojo-producing.html[POJO Producing] (see the @Produce annotation).

At the next step we want to take the beer quotes from all vendors and
find out which one was the best (i.e. the lowest!). To do this we use an
link:aggregator.html[Aggregator] with a custom aggregation strategy. The
link:aggregator.html[Aggregator] needs to be able to compare only the
messages from this particular quote; this is easily done by specifying a
correlationExpression equal to the value of the quoteRequestId header.
As shown above in the message sending snippet, we set this header to
`quoteRequest-1`. This correlation value should be unique or you may
include responses that are not part of this quote. To pick the lowest
quote out of the set, we use a custom aggregation strategy like

Finally, we expect to get the lowest quote of $1 out of $1, $2, and $3.

[[Scatter-Gather-StaticScatter-GatherExample]]
Static Scatter-Gather Example
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can lock down which recipients are used in the Scatter-Gather by
using a static link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List]. It looks
something like this

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("direct:start").multicast().to("seda:vendor1", "seda:vendor2", "seda:vendor3");

from("seda:vendor1").to("bean:vendor1").to("seda:quoteAggregator");
from("seda:vendor2").to("bean:vendor2").to("seda:quoteAggregator");
from("seda:vendor3").to("bean:vendor3").to("seda:quoteAggregator");

from("seda:quoteAggregator")
    .aggregate(header("quoteRequestId"), new LowestQuoteAggregationStrategy()).to("mock:result")
----

A full example of the static Scatter-Gather configuration can be found
in the link:loan-broker-example.html[Loan Broker Example].

[[Scatter-Gather-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
