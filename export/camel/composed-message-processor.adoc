Composed Message Processor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/DistributionAggregate.html[Composed
Message Processor] from the
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns] allows you to
process a composite message by splitting it up, routing the sub-messages
to appropriate destinations and the re-aggregating the responses back
into a single message.

In Camel we provide two solutions

* using both a link:splitter.html[Splitter] and
link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] EIPs
* using only a link:splitter.html[Splitter]

The difference is when using only a link:splitter.html[Splitter] it
aggregates back all the splitted messages into the same aggregation
group, eg like a fork/join pattern. +
Whereas using the link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] allows you group
into multiple groups, a pattern which provides more options.

Using the splitter alone is often easier and possibly a better solution.
So take a look at this first, before involving the aggregator.

[[ComposedMessageProcessor-ExampleusingbothSplitterandAggregator]]
Example using both Splitter and Aggregator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example we want to check that a multipart order can be filled.
Each part of the order requires a check at a different inventory.

*Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]*

<route>
  <from uri="direct:start"/>
  <split>
    <simple>body</simple>
    <choice>
      <when>
        <method bean="orderItemHelper" method="isWidget"/>
    <to uri="bean:widgetInventory"/>
      </when>
      <otherwise>
    <to uri="bean:gadgetInventory"/>
      </otherwise>
    </choice>
    <to uri="seda:aggregate"/>
  </split>
</route>

<route>
  <from uri="seda:aggregate"/>
  <aggregate strategyRef="myOrderAggregatorStrategy" completionTimeout="1000">
    <correlationExpression>
      <simple>header.orderId</simple>
    </correlationExpression>
    <to uri="mock:result"/>
  </aggregate>
</route>
----

To do this we split up the order using a link:splitter.html[Splitter].
The link:splitter.html[Splitter] then sends individual `OrderItems` to a
link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router] which checks the
item type. Widget items get sent for checking in the `widgetInventory`
bean and gadgets get sent to the `gadgetInventory` bean. Once these
`OrderItems` have been validated by the appropriate bean, they are sent
on to the link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] which collects and
re-assembles the validated `OrderItems` into an order again.

When an order is sent it contains a header with the order id. We use
this fact when we aggregate, as we configure this `.header("orderId")`
on the `aggregate` DSL to instruct Camel to use the header with the key
`orderId` as correlation expression.

[[ComposedMessageProcessor-ExampleusingonlySplitter]]
Example using only Splitter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example we want to split an incoming order using the
link:splitter.html[Splitter] eip, transform each order line, and then
combine the order lines into a new order message.

**Using XML**

If you use XML, then the <split> tag offers the strategyRef attribute to
refer to your custom `AggregationStrategy`

The bean with the methods to transform the order line and process the
order as well:

And the `AggregationStrategy` we use with the
link:splitter.html[Splitter] eip to combine the orders back again (eg
fork/join):

Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
