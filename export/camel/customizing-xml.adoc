Customizing the XML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The link:xml-configuration.html[Xml Configuration] is defined by JAXB
POJOs in the org.apache.camel.model.* package and its sub packages.

* If you are adding a new class you must edit the jaxb.index file to add
the class name! (One day we could hopefully have these autogenerated by
a maven plugin)
* If you add a new package, you must
** add a jaxb.index file in src/main/resources/...
** add a package-info.java file like the other model packages
** edit the JAXB_PACKAGES string in the CamelNamespaceHandler class in
camel-spring
* whenever you add anything to the XML - add some unit tests!
** if you add a new model package and want add a unit test in
XMLPaserTest, you also need to add your package into the jaxb context in
XmlTestSupport
