[[Throttler-Throttler]]
Throttler
^^^^^^^^^

The Throttler Pattern allows you to ensure that a specific endpoint does
not get overloaded, or that we don't exceed an agreed SLA with some
external service.

[[Throttler-Options]]
Options
^^^^^^^

confluenceTableSmall

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Default Value |Description
|`maximumRequestsPerPeriod` |  |Maximum number of requests per period to
throttle. This option must be provided as a positive number. Notice, in
the XML DSL, from *Camel 2.8* onwards this option is configured using an
link:expression.html[Expression] instead of an attribute.

|`timePeriodMillis` |`1000` |The time period in milliseconds, in which
the throttler will allow at most `maximumRequestsPerPeriod` number of
messages.

|`asyncDelayed` |`false` |*Camel 2.4:* If enabled then any messages
which is delayed happens asynchronously using a scheduled thread pool.

|`executorServiceRef` |  |*Camel 2.4:* Refers to a custom
link:threading-model.html[Thread Pool] to be used if `asyncDelay` has
been enabled.

|`callerRunsWhenRejected` |`true` |*Camel 2.4:* Is used if
`asyncDelayed` was enabled. This controls if the caller thread should
execute the task if the thread pool rejected the task.

|`rejectExecution` |`false` |*Camel 2.14:* If this option is true,
throttler throws a ThrottlerRejectExecutionException when the request
rate exceeds the limit.

[[Throttler-Examples]]
Examples
^^^^^^^^

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

\{snippet:id=ex|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/ThrottlerTest.java}

So the above example will throttle messages all messages received on
*seda:a* before being sent to *mock:result* ensuring that a maximum of 3
messages are sent in any 10 second window.

Note that since `timePeriodMillis` defaults to 1000 milliseconds, just
setting the `maximumRequestsPerPeriod` has the effect of setting the
maximum number of requests per second. So to throttle requests at 100
requests per second between two endpoints, it would look more like
this...

from("seda:a").throttle(100).to("seda:b");

For further examples of this pattern in use you could look at the
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/ThrottlerTest.java?view=markup[junit
test case]

*Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]*

[[Throttler-Camel2.7.xorolder]]
Camel 2.7.x or older
++++++++++++++++++++

\{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/tags/camel-2.7.0/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/throttler.xml}

[[Throttler-Camel2.8onwards]]
Camel 2.8 onwards
+++++++++++++++++

In Camel 2.8 onwards you must set the maximum period as an
link:expression.html[Expression] as shown below where we use a
link:constant.html[Constant] expression:

\{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/throttler.xml}

[[Throttler-Dynamicallychangingmaximumrequestsperperiod]]
Dynamically changing maximum requests per period
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.8* +
Since we use an link:expression.html[Expression] you can adjust this
value at runtime, for example you can provide a header with the value.
At runtime Camel evaluates the expression and converts the result to a
`java.lang.Long` type. In the example below we use a header from the
message to determine the maximum requests per period. If the header is
absent, then the link:throttler.html[Throttler] uses the old value. So
that allows you to only provide a header if the value is to be changed:

\{snippet:id=e2|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/throttler.xml}

[[Throttler-Asynchronousdelaying]]
Asynchronous delaying
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.4*

You can let the link:throttler.html[Throttler] use non blocking
asynchronous delaying, which means Camel will use a scheduler to
schedule a task to be executed in the future. The task will then
continue routing. This allows the caller thread to not block and be able
to service other messages, etc.

from("seda:a").throttle(100).asyncDelayed().to("seda:b");
