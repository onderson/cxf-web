[[Tutorial-Example-ReportIncident-Part6-...ContinuedfromPart5]]
... Continued from Part 5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We continue from part 5 where we ended up with a complete solution using
routes defined in Java code. In this last part of this tutorial we will
define the route in XML instead.

**Sidebar**

As I am writing this, its been 4.5 years since I wrote the first 5 parts
of this tutorial. Recently an user on stackoverflow praised this
tutorial said it helped him get onboard Camel. Though he was looking for
part 6 with the routes in XML. Frankly I have forgot all about adding
this part. So lets close the book and get this part into the Camel docs.

The XML code below is included in the example in
`camel-example-report-incident` in the directory
`src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/`. The file is named
`camel-context.xml`

*camel-config.xml*

[[Tutorial-Example-ReportIncident-Part6-After5yearsweareattheend]]
After 5 years we are at the end
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So finally we managed to add part 6 to this tutorial. Yes we have used a
lot of time to write this tutorial, so we hope that it helps you ride
the Camel.
