[[Camel2.7.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.7.0 release which approx 169 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

[Info]
====
 **Dependency changes**

The Camel 2.7.0 release has a number of major dependency changes:

* JDK 1.6+ is now required
* Spring 3.x+ is now required if using Spring
* http://www.slf4j.org/[slf4j] is used as logger instead of commons
logging

In other words support for JDK 1.5 and Spring 2.x has been dropped.

====

* Switched to use http://www.slf4j.org/[slf4j] as the logger instead of
commons logging.
* Camel now checks state of `Service` during starting/stopping the
link:lifecycle.html[Lifecycle] of the `Service`. This avoids double
starting/stopping in case the service was already in the desired state.
* Added support for link:mdc-logging.html[MDC logging] with Camel
* link:jms.html[JMS] consumer now eager checks if Camel is shutting down
and signals that to its `DefaultMessageListenerContainer` which avoids
trying to re-connect/failover during shutdown.
* Introduced option to automatic link:mock.html[Mock] endpoints during
testing. This makes testing without having to add link:mock.html[Mock]
endpoints in your routes a breeze. See more details at
link:mock.html[Mock] component documentation.
* Added `assertPeriod` option to link:mock.html[Mock] endpoint, which is
a period im milliseconds, that the link:mock.html[Mock] will pause and
then re-assert itself to ensure the assertion is still valid. This can
be used as a threshold when testing with expectations that *exactly* a
given number of messages should arrive on the link:mock.html[Mock]
endpoint.
* Added `arrives` DSL to link:mock.html[Mock] endpoint to allow you to
setup expectations about timespan between messages arriving on the
link:mock.html[Mock] endpoint. See more details at link:mock.html[Mock]
component documentation.
* link:http4.html[HTTP4] is upgraded to use Apache HttpClient 4.1
* Fixed an issue with link:file2.html[File] consumer having absolute
starting directory and using absolute paths in the `move` option as well
* Fixed concurrent append to the same file in the link:file2.html[File]
producer
* Fixed issue with restarting link:quartz.html[Quartz] causing a failure
due trigger name already exists issue for stateful jobs.
* Its now possible to use multiple QuartzScheduler's when deploying
multiple Camel applications in the same JVM classloader.
* link:quartz.html[Quartz] update checker is now always disabled, see
more
http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/3395.page#19058[details
here]
* Fixed potential issue installing `camel-ftp` feature in Apache
ServiceMix
* New `JdbcMessageIdRepository` for the idempotent consumer EIP in
link:sql-component.html[SQL]
* Relaxed how aggressive Camel was registering services as MBeans in
JMX. Now Camel will by default only registeres MBeans when starting
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] or starting new routes. This avoids
registering too many MBeans if using dynamic link:eip.html[EIP] patterns
such as link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] using different
endpoint urls, causing new endpoints and its associated services to be
registered in JMX. This would keep growing over time and consume memory
as well. You can use the `registerAlways` or `registerNewRoutes` options
on `ManagementAgent` to control this behavior. See
link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] for more details.
* Redelivery policy and OnException now supports
link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[property placeholders] in both Java
and XML DSLs.
* Introduced link:redeliverypolicy.html[`<redeliveryPolicyProfile>`] to
easily define common profiles for link:redeliverypolicy.html[redelivery
policies], which you can refer to from `<errorHandler>` or
`<onException>` using the `redeliveryPolicyRef` attribute. Also Spring
Frameworks property placeholders works with `<redeliveryPolicyProfile>`.
* Improved the XML based link:error-handler.html[Error Handler]s to
validate configuration on startup, to fail if they have been
misconfigured.
* link:springintegration.html[Spring Integration] is upgraded to Spring
Integration 2.0.
* Added `endChoice()` to the Java DSL to be able to use any
link:eip.html[EIP]s inside the link:content-based-router.html[Content
Based Router]. See more
link:why-can-i-not-use-when-or-otherwise-in-a-java-camel-route.html[details
here]
* link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Property placeholders] can now be
use for any kind of attributes/options in the link:eip.html[EIP]s in the
Camel routes. For example in the Spring XML file you can now use
placeholders for timeout attributes etc. This is possible using the
specialized placeholder namespace. See more details at the
link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Using PropertyPlaceholder] wiki
page. In the Java DSL there is a new `placeholder` option on each
link:eip.html[EIP] you can leverage.
* The `camel-jdbc-aggregator` component is merged into the `camel-sql`
component.
* Fix in link:mail.html[Mail] component for duplicate attachments, and
when using starttls.
* Maven 3 is now supported for building
* Tidy up the XML DSL to not allow nesting tags where it doesn't make
sense.
* Internal cleanup in route preparation logic to be fully shared for all
DSLs (before the XML DSLs and Java DSL was a bit different)
* Fixed link:intercept.html[InterceptFrom] to work with from endpoints
defined using ref's or instances (eg everything but uris)
* Fixed link:http.html[HTTP] and link:http4.html[HTTP4] producers double
encoding endpoint uri, when calling external service
* Fixed link:jms.html[JMS] producer not working with OracleAQ throwing
exception on accessing `JMSReplyTo`
* Added support for using link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[OSGi
Blueprint property placeholder] service with Camel routes. Camel uses
convention over configuration so all you have to do is to define the
OSGi blueprint placeholder and you can refer to those from the
`<camelContext>`. Pay attention to the placeholder tokens using by Camel
is \{\{ }}.
* `<threadPoolProfile>` and `<threadPool>` is now easier to use with
link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[property placeholders]
* link:properties.html[Properties] component now supports JVM system
properties and OS environment variables in the locations option. For
example using `"file:${karaf.home}/etc/foo.properties"` to refer to the
`foo.proeprties` file in the http://karaf.apache.org/[Apache Karaf]
installation.
* Fixed an issue with link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] in
parallel mode, not reusing background aggregator thread
* Fixed an issue with dependency ordering when using Spring's
`depends-on` attribute between multiple `<camelContext>`.
* link:servlet.html[SERVLET] component doesn't hijack Spring to start
the web application anymore. Spring and CamelServlet is now independent.
See more at important changes to consider when upgrading.
* Fixed all link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel Maven Archetypes] to
use new Maven format and ensured they all work out of the box.
* link:web-console.html[Web Console] upgraded to Scalate 1.4.1, and the
webpages is now precompiled
* link:jt400.html[JT400] can now execute program calls on the AS/400
* link:cache.html[Cache] now only mandates a message body for the add
and update operations. This makes get operation possible for messages
with no existing body.
* Fixed issue when link:jetty.html[Jetty] continuation timeouts has been
triggered before link:asynchronous-routing-engine.html[Asynchronous
Routing Engine] has reply ready. This would cause Jetty to log WARN logs
about illegal state.

[[Camel2.7.0Release-APIbreaking]]
API breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `FATAL` has been removed from `org.apache.camel.LoggingLevel`. Use
`ERROR` instead.
* `org.apache.camel.processor.Logger` has been renamed to
`org.apache.camel.processor.CamelLogger`, and it now uses
http://www.slf4j.org/[slf4j] as the logger.
* Removed `getLeftValue` and `getRightValue` methods on
`BinaryPredicate`.
* The `ref` attribute on `<redeliveryPolicy>` has been removed. Instead
use `redeliveryPolicyRef` attribute on `<onException>` or
`<errorHandler>` tags.
* The `<batch-config>` and `<stream-config>` tags in XML DSL in the
link:resequencer.html[Resequencer] EIP must now be configured in the
top, and not in the bottom. So if you use those, then move them up just
below the `<resequence>` link:eip.html[EIP] starts in the XML.
* The `JdbcAggregationRepository` is moved from the
`camel-jdbc-aggregator` component to the `camel-sql` component. The full
qualified class name changed from
`org.apache.camel.component.jdbc.aggregationRepository.JdbcAggregationRepository`
to
`org.apache.camel.processor.aggregate.jdbc.JdbcAggregationRepository`.
* `sortBody` methods removed from Java DSL. You can use `sort(body())`
instead.
* The link:sort.html[Sort] EIP in XML DSL is now configured the
expression directly. Which means you no longer need to use
`<expression>` enclosing the expression. Instead you set the expression
directly, just as the other link:eip.html[EIP]s does.
* Method `parsePropertyValue` renamed to `parseProperty` and have
additional parameters in the `PropertiesParser` interface.

[[Camel2.7.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The link:tracer.html[Tracer] may not output all details for some
situations such as when using `onCompletion` or `intercept` etc.
* Not all link:examples.html[Examples] have ANT build.xml files to run
the example using ANT.
* `camel-script` which uses `ScriptEngineManager` from the JDK, cannot
load script engines from packages outside the JDK (i.e. when running in
OSGi).
* Stopping a route after using `adviceWith` maybe cause issues with
error handlers, see
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3534[CAMEL-3534]
* The project cannot fully build the site using Maven (eg running
`"mvn site"`. There is no plan to make this work as the project do not
use the maven site.
* The link:cxf-tomcat-example.html[CXF Tomcat Example] does not work on
Tomcat 7 due a bug in
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-3362[Apache CXF 2.3.3] that
camel-cxf uses by default. When CXF 2.3.4 is released you can upgrade
and the example should work.
* The `camel-spring-ws` feature does not work in Apache ServiceMix or
Apache Karaf.
* The `camel-cache` feature cannot load the `ehcache-failsafe.xml` file.
* The default cacheLevel on link:jms.html[JMS] is always
`CACHE_CONSUMER`. However this impacts performance when using
transacted=true. The workaround is to set `cacheLevelName=CACHE_NONE` if
you use transaction.
* Stopping a route having a context scoped error handler, may cause the
error handler to stop as well, causing it to not work if it was used by
other routes, see
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3878[CAMEL-3878]

[[Camel2.7.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Java 1.6 or better is required
* Spring 3.0.5 or better is required, when using Spring
* Apache CXF 2.3.3 or better is required, when using CXF
* Switched to use http://www.slf4j.org/[slf4j] as the logger instead of
commons logging. That means you may have to included `slf4j-log4j12` as
dependency if you are using log4j. +
See documentation at http://www.slf4j.org/[slf4j] for more details.
* If you have developed custom Camel link:component.html[Component]s and
your `Endpoint` class extends `DefaultEndpoint` then its advised to use
the `doStart` and `doStop` instead of `start` and `stop`.
* You can not access the attachment by using Message.getAttachement(id)
if the camel-cxf endpoint works in POJO data format, please access the
attachment objects from the camel message body.
* link:restlet.html[camel-restlet] has been upgraded from Restlet 1.1.x
to 2.0.5
* link:servlet.html[SERVLET] does not startup Spring XML file anymore.
You should startup the XML file using 100% Spring style using the
ContextLoaderListener in the web.xml. See the the
link:servlet-tomcat-example.html[Servlet Tomcat Example] example for
details.
* link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel Maven Archetypes] the archetype
`camel-archetype-war` has been renamed to `camel-archetype-webconsole`.
