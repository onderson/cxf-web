[[Camel2.6.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.6.0 release which approx 297 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Fixed issue in OSGi with refreshing Camel bundles causing a race
condition when discovering type converters
* Introduced link:scheduledroutepolicy.html[ScheduledRoutePolicy] with
the link:quartz.html[Quartz] component
* Java DSL link:routebuilder.html[RouteBuilder] now fails if
`onException` and the likes are not configured before routes, which they
must.
* Easier to debug routes from `camel-test` using the
link:debugger.html[Debugger]
* Fixed problem installing `camel-cxf` feature on Apache Karaf.
* The link:eip.html[EIP] now supports link:properties.html[property
placeholders] in the `String` based options (a few spots in Java DSL
where its not possible). For example:
+
[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<convertBodyTo type="String" charset="{{foo.myCharset}}"/>
----
* Introduced link:scheduledroutepolicy.html[ScheduledRoutePolicy] to
allow you to schedule when routes should be active.
* Introduced `stepwise` option to link:ftp2.html[FTP] component to allow
end users to control how to traverse directories of the FTP servers.
This allows you to set `stepwise=false` to return back to the behavior
from Camel 2.0 - 2.4. See more at the link:ftp2.html[FTP] documentation.
* Added `separator` option to link:ftp2.html[FTP] component to allow end
users to control what path separator to use when uploading files to
remote FTP servers. For example if a Windows based FTP server only
accept Windows paths, then you can set this option to `Windows`.
* link:threading-model.html[Thread names] now outputs
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] name which makes it easier to
differentiate when running multiple Camel applications in the same JVM.
* Introduced `contentCache` option to link:xslt.html[XSLT] component to
allow easy reloading of stylesheets during development.
* Improved link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] to always find next free name
when registering in JMX and existing name exists (to remedy name clash).
This makes it easier when deploying muliple WARs in the same JVM where
the Camel applications may have same
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] id. In OSGi the name in JMX now has
the bundle id as prefix.
* Fixed link:beanshell.html[BeanShell] language
* link:quartz.html[Quartz] now supports using older versions (eg
versions 1.6/1.7) of quartz JARs.
* The link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] EIP will use a synchronous
invocation when processing completed aggregated
link:exchange.html[Exchange]s, when not running in parallel mode. This
ensures no internal task queue is used, which otherwise could stack up
tasks and under certain conditions eat up memory. Enable
`parallelProcessing` if you want to use a separate thread for processing
completed aggregated link:exchange.html[Exchange]s.
* link:ldap.html[LDAP] supports paging.
* link:cxf.html[CXF] and link:cxfrs.html[CXFRS] use the CXF continuation
API when using CXF 2.3.x.
* You can access the CXF Message from the Camel message header by using
the key "CamelCxfMessage" after the link:cxf.html[CXF] consumer.
* Fixed a rare situation in which an link:exchange.html[Exchange] could
be lost during graceful shutdown on the link:seda.html[SEDA] endpoints,
usually more apparent on high volume systems.
* Improved support for Locale in link:bindy.html[Bindy] for Number and
Date formats.
* Fixed link:multicast.html[Multicast], link:splitter.html[Splitter],
link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] to work as the
link:pipes-and-filters.html[Pipes and Filters] would do, breaking to
continue routing if a sub exchange failed and was handled by an
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause]. Previously you would have
to detect this manually in the `AggregationStrategy`.
* Constant fields from link:exchange.html[Exchange] can be referred in
the link:dsl.html[DSL] from a String attribute using the class type
style. This makes the Java DSL and Spring XML more similar. And you got
type safe as Camel throws exception if you had a typo. +
For example:
+
[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<setHeader headerName="Exchange.FILE_NAME"><constant>myfile.txt</constant></setHeader>
----
* link:exchange.html[Exchange] now contains the creation timestamp when
it was created as a `java.util.Date` object stores as a property with
the key `Exchange.CREATION_TIMESTAMP`
* Camel fails fast on startup if link:load-balancer.html[Load Balancer]
has been misconfigured, such as configuring two different load balancers
in one
* Fixed `markRollbackOnlyLast` when used with inner/outer transactions.
* `InterceptStrategy` is now default ordered in the order they are added
to the link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext]. However you can dictate the
order by implementing the `org.apache.camel.util.Ordered` interface.
* Made it easier to load routes from XML files using
`loadRoutesDefinition` method from link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext].
* Added support for custom multipart filters in link:jetty.html[Jetty].
* Using link:processor.html[Processor] or link:bean.html[Bean] in routes
is now also enlisted in JMX for management.
* The ObjectName for `processor` in JMX is now always using the node id
it has been assigned in the route.
* Using a custom link:processor.html[Processor] or link:bean.html[Bean]
will be enlisted in JMX having its custom attributes/operations listed.
For example just use the Spring JMX annotations to easily expose the
attributes/operations. See more
link:why-is-my-processor-not-showing-up-in-jconsole.html[details here].
* Fixed some issue with the `camel-blueprint` component.
* Added features to `camel-blueprint` component so its on-par with
feature set from Spring XML.
* Fixed link:ftp2.html[FTP] producer may creating directory using
windows path separators.
* Fixed link:intercept.html[InterceptSendToEndpoint] not honoring `stop`
DSL to stop immediately and not sending the link:exchange.html[Exchange]
to the intercepted link:endpoint.html[Endpoint].
* Improved the link:irc.html[IRC] component
* Added `matchsMockWaitTime` method to
link:notifybuilder.html[NotifyBuilder] which is a convenient method to
use when testing with mocks and want to match using timeout.
* `org.apache.camel.spi.EventNotifier` events for
link:exchange.html[Exchange] done is now fired *after*
link:oncompletion.html[OnCompletion] has been executed.
* Added option `deleteOutputFile` to link:xslt.html[XSLT] component.
* link:idempotent-consumer.html[Idempotent Consumer]'s
`IdempotentRepository` is now managed in link:camel-jmx.html[JMX].
* link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] producers now support
writing _done_ files after the target file has been written, using the
new `doneFileName` option.
* link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumers now support
only consuming files if a _done_ file exists, using the new
`doneFileName` option.
* link:threading-model.html[Thread Pools] is now named more intuitive in
link:camel-jmx.html[JMX], making it much easier for end user to spot
which pool is used for what. And it provides more information where the
pool is used.
* link:data-format.html[Data Format] now supports `Service` and
`CamelContextAware` callbacks which means its much easier to perform
custom initialization logic in your data formats.
* Fixed link:printer.html[Printer] component to use exact same constants
for `mediaSize` option as from the Java Printer API.
* Fixed issue with route scoped link:exception-clause.html[Exception
Clause] may pick link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] defined on
another route, if exception is the same type. Also ensures that route
scoped is preferred over context scoped.
* Fixed link:bindy.html[Bindy] fixed length to throw exception if field
exceeds allowed length. Added option `clip` on `@DataField` to allow
link:bindy.html[Bindy] to clip the field so it fits the length, instead
of thrown an exception.
* Fixed link:bindy.html[Bindy] when using quoted CSV records and fixed
when using pipeline delimiter.
* Added header `Exchange.REDELIVERY_MAX_COUNTER` to message when Camel
performs a redelivery attempt. This header contains the maximum
redelivery setting. It may be `null` if you use unlimited redelivery
attempts or use `retryWhile`.
* link:jms.html[JMS] producer using `InOnly` MEP now supports
`JMSReplyTo` configured on either endpoint, or provided as message
header. The message send to the JMS destination will now contain the
`JMSReplyTo` information. The link:jms.html[JMS] producer which send the
message will still be `InOnly` and not expect/wait for a reply but
continue immediately. You have to have the `preserveMessageQos=true`
option defined as well.
* Fixed link:jms.html[JMS] producer, when a `JMSReplyTo` header was
provided as a message header, removing any `queue:` or `topic:` prefix
causing the reply to destination to be resolved correctly (eg avoiding
having `queue:` in the queue name).
* link:jms.html[JMS] producer now honors, if reply to was disabled using
`disableReplyTo=true` in all situations.
* link:http.html[HTTP], link:jetty.html[Jetty],
link:servlet.html[SERVLET] and `camel-http4` now supports content type
`application/x-java-serialized-object` on both the producer and consumer
side. This allows you to transfer serialized Java objects over http.
* Added option `transferException` to link:http.html[HTTP],
link:jetty.html[Jetty] and link:servlet.html[SERVLET], which allows you
to return back caused exceptions from the consumer side as serialized
objects. On the producer side the caused exception will be thrown
instead of the generic `HttpOperationFailedException`.
* link:web-console.html[Web Console] now displays some basic route
statistics if link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] is enabled.
* link:jpa.html[JPA] `JpaTraceEventMessage` now uses `@Lob` for fields
which may contain a lot of data, such as message body.
* link:log.html[Throughput logger] now supports logging per interval
(timer based).
* Fixed an issue with link:splitter.html[Splitter] causing exception
mistakenly from one sub-message being propagated to the next
sub-message.
* link:xquery.html[XQuery] now strips all whitespaces by default; there
is an option to changes this to ignorable whitepsaces only.
* link:quartz.html[Quartz] now enforces trigger name/group to be unique
within the given component. Will throw exception on name clash detected.
This behavior does not apply for clustered quartz.
* Fixed link:splitter.html[Splitter] using too much memory when running
in parallel mode. Now it aggregates on-the-fly and memory consumption is
low and stable.
* link:bean.html[Bean] now has a type option which you can use if you
use method overloading in your Bean and prevent Camel to fail with an
`AmbiguousMethodCallException`.
* Added `Main` class to `camel-core` so you can do:
link:running-camel-standalone-and-have-it-keep-running.html[Running
Camel standalone and have it keep running]
* Added
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=CAMEL&title=JDBC-AggregationRepository&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=24184529[JDBC]
based persistent support for link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] EIP
* Fixed link:jetty.html[Jetty] may throw NPE during heavy load.
* Continuation timeout can be configured on link:jetty.html[Jetty]. By
default link:jetty.html[Jetty] uses 30 sec timeout. There is also a new
option to disable using Jetty continuation.
* link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer]'s
`PollingConsumerPollStrategy` now provides number of messages actually
processed in the poll in the `commit` callback message. You can use this
to know if none messages was polled, or that X number of message was
polled.
* link:dozer-type-conversion.html[Dozer] now works with OSGi
* Fixed an issue with link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] which could lead
to it not confirm completions on the `AggregationRepository`. And as
well the internal "in progress completed exchanges" map wouldn't neither
remove the completed exchange, causing it to grow memory over time.
* The `bean` DSLs will eager check on startup, the provided method name
is a valid method name on the bean as well. This helps to fail fast if
end users have a typo in their routes.
* link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful Shutdown] a single route now
supports a `abortOnTimeout` option, which if enabled will let the route
be running if it could not shutdown the route within a given timeout
period.
* Fixed `loadRoutesDefinition` and `addRouteDefinition` to used shared
logic from `camel-core-xml` to ensure loading routes from XML files
works exactly the same as if the routes was defined in Spring or
Blueprint XML files.
* Camel now fail on startup if it cannot load type converters from the
classpath, which is essential for it to operate correctly.
* Fixed `completionFromBatchConsumer` option on the
link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] not aggregating the last incoming
link:exchange.html[Exchange] under certain conditions.
* Fixed a few code generation issues related to
link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel Maven Archetypes]
* link:properties.html[Properties] component will trim values from
loaded properties. This fixes a problem when you have trailing spaces
for values in a properties file.
* Fixed `trim` option on `@DataField` annotation not working in
link:bindy.html[Bindy] when unmarshalling fixed length records.
* Added `ref` function to link:simple.html[Simple] expression language
so you can lookup any link:bean.html[Bean] from the
link:registry.html[Registry].

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The link:tracer.html[Tracer] may not output all details for some
situations such as when using `onCompletion` or `intercept` etc.
* Not all link:examples.html[Examples] have ANT build.xml files to run
the example using ANT.

than "1.5.0_24"
* `camel-script` which uses `ScriptEngineManager` from the JDK, cannot
load script engines from packages outside the JDK (i.e. when running in
OSGi).
* Stopping a route after using `adviceWith` maybe cause issues with
error handlers, see
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3534[CAMEL-3534]
* If you use link:quartz.html[Quartz] then pay attention that its

reuse background aggregator thread. See
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3727[CAMEL-3727]
* The `camel-spring-ws` feature does not work in Apache ServiceMix or
Apache Karaf.

[[Camel2.6.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Info]
====


Starting with camel-2.7.0 we are dropping support for java 1.5, spring
2.5.6 and junit 3. These technologies may still be supported for a short
while on a 2.6.x branch depending on the community interest. See
link:camel-27-roadmap.html[Camel 2.7 - Roadmap].

====

* Upgraded to Spring 3.0.5
* Upgraded to Apache CXF 2.3.1 (although CXF 2.2.11 is still supported)
* Upgraded to Jetty 7.2.2.v20101205
* The Java DSL now enforces `onException` and the likes to be defined
*before* routes, if not Camel will fail starting the route.
* The link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] EIP will use a synchronous
invocation when processing completed aggregated
link:exchange.html[Exchange]s, when not running in parallel mode. This
ensures no internal task queue is used, which otherwise could stack up
tasks and under certain conditions eat up memory. Enable
`parallelProcessing` if you want to use a separate thread for processing
completed aggregated link:exchange.html[Exchange]s.
* Camel now fails fast if staring a `LifecycleStrategy` fails on
startup. For example if there is issue with link:camel-jmx.html[JMX]
that will now cause Camel to not startup at all. If you have trouble
with JMX before you can disable JMX on Camel and allow it to startup.
* `ManagementAware` has been @deprecated. Just enrich your class with
the Spring JMX annotations, if you want custom management of your
components, endpoints, processors and so fort. See more at
link:why-is-my-processor-not-showing-up-in-jconsole.html[Why is my
processor not showing up in JConsole].
* link:data-format.html[Data Format] now supports `Service` and
`CamelContextAware` callbacks which means its much easier to perform
custom initialization logic in your data formats.
* The `mediaSize` option on link:printer.html[Printer] now uses exact
same constants as the Java Printer API. Which means it uses underscores
instead of hyphens in the constants.
* link:jpa.html[JPA] `JpaTraceEventMessage` now uses `@Lob` for fields
which may contain a lot of data, such as message body.
* link:quartz.html[Quartz] now enforces trigger name/group to be unique
within the given component. Will throw exception on name clash detected.
This behavior does not apply for clustered quartz.
* Camel now fail on startup if it cannot load type converters from the
classpath, which is essential for it to operate correctly.
