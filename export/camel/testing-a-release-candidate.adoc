When a release candidate has been cut, a vote is started, inviting all
members of the community to test the release candidate before actually
declaring it an official release. What/how to test before casting your
vote?

[[Testingareleasecandidate-Checkingthedistributables(tar.gzand/orzipfiles)]]
Checking the distributables (tar.gz and/or zip files)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just download the distributables and check their contents:

* do they contain the appropriate source/class/jar files?
* do they contain the required legal files?
* do they have the correct MD5/SHA1 sum?

[[Testingareleasecandidate-Buildingthereleasecandidatefromsource]]
Building the release candidate from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download and unpack the release candidate's source distribution. To test
if all dependencies are available and all the necessary Maven
repositories have been properly declared, it's best to temporarily move
aside (or delete) your local Maven repo:

....
mv ~/.m2 ~/.m2.backup
....

Afterwards, do a full build link:building.html[as usual], preferably
including running all unit tests.

[[Testingareleasecandidate-Testingthebinarydistributionbyrunningtheexamples]]
Testing the binary distribution by running the examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download and unpack the binary distribution. Try running the
link:examples.html[examples].

If you skipped the previous step (Building the release candidate), you
will have to specify the staging repo whenever you execute a mvn command
for testing the examples

....
mvn camel:run -DremoteRepo=http://people.apache.org/~hadrian/apache-camel-1.4.0-RC1/maven2
....
