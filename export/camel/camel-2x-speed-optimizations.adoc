Camel 2.x Speed optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This design page is about how to optimize and make Camel 2.x more
performant.

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-Sourcecode]]
Source code
^^^^^^^^^^^

We got an experiment branch at Apache at:
`https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/sandbox/tuning-experiment/`

You are welcome to checkout the branch and help along with tuning.

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-ReduceExchangecopying]]
Reduce Exchange copying
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*DONE in Camel 2.8* +
The first issue to address is to reduce the need for copying exchanges.

Currently Camel does defensive copying of the current Exchange being
routed. This happens in `org.apache.camel.processor.Pipeline`. +
This hotspot should be reduced as the Pipeline should *not* do defensive
copy of the Exchange.

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-MessageFacade]]
Message Facade
++++++++++++++

We should introduce a message facade to detect mutations to messages. +
The code is in `org.apache.camel.impl.CopyOnWriteMessageFacade`.

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-INshouldbeimmutable]]
IN should be immutable
++++++++++++++++++++++

If IN is immutable it makes redelivery much easier as we just pass in IN
yet again. +
The code is in `org.apache.camel.impl.ImmutableMessage`.

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-Onlywhenredelivering]]
Only when redelivering
++++++++++++++++++++++

*DONE in Camel 2.8* +
A defensive copy of the Exchange is *only* needed when Camel does
redelivery using its link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] features. So
the goal is to move +
the defensive copy from the Pipeline to
`org.apache.camel.processor.RedeliveryErrorHandler`. As this error
handler is the base for doing redelivery within Camel itself. Then the
speed gain is when users do not use this error handler at all.

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-OptimizeRedeliveryErrorHandler]]
Optimize RedeliveryErrorHandler
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*DONE in Camel 2.8* +
A second goal is to implement logic in RedeliveryErrorHandler to only do
defensive copying if a redelivery is possible. End users need to
explicit enable redelivery in Camel. By implementing logic if a
redelivery is ever possible or not we can reduce the copying even
further.

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-OnlycopyMessageandnotExchange]]
Only copy Message and not Exchange
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*WONT FIX* +
Another goal is to only copy the IN message as its the *input* to a
processor, and where the processor can mutate it. So instead of copying
the entire Exchange we can reduce it to only copying the IN message.
This enforces the convention that Exchange properties will not be
copied.

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-NotmanyprocessorscanmutateINmessage]]
Not many processors can mutate IN message
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Many of the processors (eg transports, protocols etc.) do not
mutate/modify the IN message so we can leverage this fact that a copy is
only needed in some situations. For instance the File producer do not
mutate the IN message so we do not need to copy it even if we do
redelivery.

Logic can be build in to cater for this. For instance:

* Some interface to indicate whether a Processor can mutate or not.
* .process can mutate (you get access to the entire Exchange)
* .bean can mutate (only in some situations)
* we can allow end users to indicate whether they mutate the exchange or
not
* we can let end users set a flag on the exchange if it was mutated
* we can add some proxy if getBody/setBody getHeader/setHeader was
invoked on IN message to indicate if it was possible to mutate it

We dont have to go all the way, by having just all the Camel
component/processors being able to indicate whether they can mutate or
not is a big win. +
The optimizations of bean/process can be secondary objective as it can
be a bit overkill and complex.

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-Coarsegrainedperformancecounters]]
Coarse grained performance counters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*DONE in Camel 2.1* +
The JMX performance counters is very fine grained today. We should
reduce this to only do performance counts for the entire route instead
of spanning every single node in the route path.

And we should add options for JMX to enable/disable this as you may not
want to grab these details but only want JMX to be able to manage
producers, consumers, routes and endpoints etc.

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-Channel]]
Channel
+++++++

Optimize Channel to be able to skip doing hoops through interceptors
that is not needed such as: JMX, StreamCaching, Error Handler etc. when
these are configured as disabled to be more strait through.

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-UsingYourKitprofiler]]
Using YourKit profiler
++++++++++++++++++++++

We should use a profiler to aid find hotspots to optimize.

Claus used YourKit to find the following hot spots:

* type converter to String could be greatly optimized as it tended to go
over fallback converters
* recipient list with only 1 element could be avoid to not use a Scanner
as creating a Scanner costs performance

[[Camel2.xSpeedoptimizations-Performancetests]]
Performance tests
+++++++++++++++++

We should have some performance tests we can run and see what we
archive.

A very crude experiment from Claus showed 2x gain by avoiding doing
excessive exchange copies in the `RoutePerformanceTest` unit test by
modifying the `Pipeline` processor to not do a copy of the Exchange.
