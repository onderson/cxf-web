Dead Letter Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/DeadLetterChannel.html[Dead
Letter Channel] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns] using the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/processor/DeadLetterChannel.html[DeadLetterChannel]
processor which is an link:error-handler.html[Error Handler].

Differences Between The DeadLetterChannel And The DefaultErrorHandler

The *`DefaultErrorHandler`* does very little: it ends the Exchange
immediately and propagates the thrown Exception back to the caller.

The *`DeadLetterChannel`* lets you control behaviors including
redelivery, whether to propagate the thrown Exception to the caller
(the *`handled`* option), and where the (failed) Exchange should now be
routed to.

The *`DeadLetterChannel`* is also by default configured to not be
verbose in the logs, so when a message is handled and moved to the dead
letter endpoint, then there is nothing logged. If you want some level of
logging you can use the various options on the redelivery policy / dead
letter channel to configure this. For example if you want the message
history then set *`logExhaustedMessageHistory=true`*
(and *`logHandled=true`* for *Camel 2.15.x* or older).

When the *`DeadLetterChannel`* moves a message to the dead letter
endpoint, any new Exception thrown is by default handled by the dead
letter channel as well. This ensures that the *`DeadLetterChannel`* will
always succeed. From *Camel 2.15*: this behavior can be changed by
setting the option *`deadLetterHandleNewException=false`*. Then if a new
Exception is thrown, then the dead letter channel will fail and
propagate back that new Exception (which is the behavior of the default
error handler). When a new Exception occurs then the dead letter channel
logs this at *`WARN`* level. This can be turned off by setting
*`logNewException=false`*.

[[DeadLetterChannel-Redelivery]]
Redelivery
^^^^^^^^^^

It is common for a temporary outage or database deadlock to cause a
message to fail to process; but the chances are if its tried a few more
times with some time delay then it will complete fine. So we typically
wish to use some kind of redelivery policy to decide how many times to
try redeliver a message and how long to wait before redelivery attempts.

The
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/processor/RedeliveryPolicy.html[RedeliveryPolicy]
defines how the message is to be redelivered. You can customize things
like

* The number of times a message is attempted to be redelivered before it
is considered a failure and sent to the dead letter channel.
* The initial redelivery timeout.
* Whether or not exponential backoff is used, i.e., the time between
retries increases using a backoff multiplier.
* Whether to use collision avoidance to add some randomness to the
timings.
* Delay pattern (see below for details).
* *Camel 2.11:* Whether to allow redelivery during stopping/shutdown.

Once all attempts at redelivering the message fails then the message is
forwarded to the dead letter queue.

[[DeadLetterChannel-AboutMovingExchangetoDeadLetterQueueandUsinghandled()]]
About Moving Exchange to Dead Letter Queue and Using *`handled()`*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*`handled()`* on link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel]

When all attempts of redelivery have failed the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] is moved to the dead letter queue (the dead
letter endpoint). The exchange is then complete and from the client
point of view it was processed. As such the
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] have handled the
link:exchange.html[Exchange].

For instance configuring the dead letter channel as:

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

javaerrorHandler(deadLetterChannel("jms:queue:dead")
.maximumRedeliveries(3).redeliveryDelay(5000));

*Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]*

xml<route errorHandlerRef="myDeadLetterErrorHandler"> <!-- ... -->
</route> <bean id="myDeadLetterErrorHandler"
class="org.apache.camel.builder.DeadLetterChannelBuilder"> <property
name="deadLetterUri" value="jms:queue:dead"/> <property
name="redeliveryPolicy" ref="myRedeliveryPolicyConfig"/> </bean> <bean
id="myRedeliveryPolicyConfig"
class="org.apache.camel.processor.RedeliveryPolicy"> <property
name="maximumRedeliveries" value="3"/> <property name="redeliveryDelay"
value="5000"/> </bean>

The link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] above will clear
the caused exception *`setException(null)`*, by moving the caused
exception to a property on the link:exchange.html[Exchange], with the
key *`Exchange.EXCEPTION_CAUGHT`*. Then the link:exchange.html[Exchange]
is moved to the *`jms:queue:dead`* destination and the client will not
notice the failure.

[[DeadLetterChannel-AboutMovingExchangetoDeadLetterQueueandUsingtheOriginalMessage]]
About Moving Exchange to Dead Letter Queue and Using the Original
Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The option *`useOriginalMessage`* is used for routing the original input
message instead of the current message that potentially is modified
during routing.

For instance if you have this route:

java from("jms:queue:order:input") .to("bean:validateOrder")
.to("bean:transformOrder") .to("bean:handleOrder");

The route listen for JMS messages and validates, transforms and handle
it. During this the link:exchange.html[Exchange] payload is
transformed/modified. So in case something goes wrong and we want to
move the message to another JMS destination, then we can configure our
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] with
the *`useOriginalMessage`* option. But when we move the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] to this destination we do not know in which
state the message is in. Did the error happen in before
the *`transformOrder`* or after? So to be sure we want to move the
original input message we received from *`jms:queue:order:input`*. So we
can do this by enabling the *`useOriginalMessage`* option as shown
below:

java// will use original body
errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("jms:queue:dead") .useOriginalMessage()
.maximumRedeliveries(5) .redeliverDelay(5000);

Then the messages routed to the *`jms:queue:dead`* is the original
input. If we want to manually retry we can move the JMS message from the
failed to the input queue, with no problem as the message is the same as
the original we received.

[[DeadLetterChannel-OnRedelivery]]
OnRedelivery
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] is doing
redeliver its possible to configure a link:processor.html[Processor]
that is executed just *before* every redelivery attempt. This can be
used for the situations where you need to alter the message before its
redelivered. See below for sample.

onException and onRedeliver

We also support for per link:exception-clause.html[*onException*] to set
an *`onRedeliver`*. That means you can do special on redelivery for
different exceptions, as opposed to *`onRedelivery`* set on
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] can be viewed as a
global scope.

[[DeadLetterChannel-RedeliveryDefaultValues]]
Redelivery Default Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Redelivery is disabled by default.

The default redeliver policy will use the following values:

* *`maximumRedeliveries=0`*
* *`redeliverDelay=1000L`* (1 second)
* *`maximumRedeliveryDelay = 60 * 1000L`* (60 seconds)
* *`backOffMultiplier`* and *`useExponentialBackOff`* are ignored.
* *`retriesExhaustedLogLevel=LoggingLevel.ERROR`*
* *`retryAttemptedLogLevel=LoggingLevel.DEBUG`*
* Stack traces are logged for exhausted messages, from *Camel 2.2*.
* Handled exceptions are not logged, from *Camel 2.3*.
* *`logExhaustedMessageHistory`* is true for default error handler, and
false for dead letter channel.
* *`logExhaustedMessageBody`* *Camel 2.17:* is disabled by default to
avoid logging sensitive message body/header details. If this option is
*`true`*, then *`logExhaustedMessageHistory`* must also be *`true`*.

The maximum redeliver delay ensures that a delay is never longer than
the value, default 1 minute. This can happen when
*`useExponentialBackOff=true`*.

The *`maximumRedeliveries`* is the number of *re*-delivery attempts. By
default Camel will try to process the exchange 1 + 5 times. 1 time for
the normal attempt and then 5 attempts as redeliveries. +
Setting the *`maximumRedeliveries=-1 `*(or < *`-1`*) will then always
redelivery (unlimited). +
Setting the *`maximumRedeliveries=0`* will disable re-delivery.

Camel will log delivery failures at the *`DEBUG`* logging level by
default. You can change this by specifying *`retriesExhaustedLogLevel`*
and/or *`retryAttemptedLogLevel`*. See
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/builder/ExceptionBuilderWithRetryLoggingLevelSetTest.java[ExceptionBuilderWithRetryLoggingLevelSetTest]
for an example.

You can turn logging of stack traces on/off. If turned off Camel will
still log the redelivery attempt. It's just much less verbose.

[[DeadLetterChannel-RedeliverDelayPattern]]
Redeliver Delay Pattern
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Delay pattern is used as a single option to set a range pattern for
delays. When a delay pattern is in use the following options no longer
apply:

* *`delay`*
* *`backOffMultiplier`*
* *`useExponentialBackOff`*
* *`useCollisionAvoidance`*
* *`maximumRedeliveryDelay`*

The idea is to set groups of ranges using the following syntax:
*`limit:delay;limit 2:delay 2;limit 3:delay 3;...;limit N:delay N`*

Each group has two values separated with colon:

* *`limit`* = upper limit
* *`delay`* = delay in milliseconds +
And the groups is again separated with semi-colon. The rule of thumb is
that the next groups should have a higher limit than the previous group.

Lets clarify this with an example: +
*`delayPattern=5:1000;10:5000;20:20000`*

That gives us three groups:

* *`5:1000`*
* *`10:5000`*
* *`20:20000`*

Resulting in these delays between redelivery attempts:

* Redelivery attempt number *`1..4 = 0ms`* (as the first group start
with 5)
* Redelivery attempt number *`5..9 = 1000ms`* (the first group)
* Redelivery attempt number *`10..19 = 5000ms`* (the second group)
* Redelivery attempt number *`20.. = 20000ms`* (the last group)

Note: The first redelivery attempt is *`1`*, so the first group should
start with *`1`* or higher.

You can start a group with limit *`1`* to e.g., have a starting delay:
*`delayPattern=1:1000;5:5000`*

* Redelivery attempt number *`1..4 = 1000ms`* (the first group)
* Redelivery attempt number *`5.. = 5000ms`* (the last group)

There is no requirement that the next delay should be higher than the
previous. You can use any delay value you like. For example with
*`delayPattern=1:5000;3:1000`* we start with 5 sec delay and then later
reduce that to *`1`* second.

[[DeadLetterChannel-Redeliveryheader]]
Redelivery header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a message is redelivered the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/processor/DeadLetterChannel.html[DeadLetterChannel]
will append a customizable header to the message to indicate how many
times its been redelivered. +
Before *Camel 2.6*: The header is *`CamelRedeliveryCounter`*, which is
also defined on the *`Exchange.REDELIVERY_COUNTER`*. +
From *Camel 2.6*: The header *`CamelRedeliveryMaxCounter`*, which is
also defined on the *`Exchange.REDELIVERY_MAX_COUNTER`*, contains the
maximum redelivery setting. This header is absent if you use
*`retryWhile`* or have unlimited maximum redelivery configured.

And a boolean flag whether it is being redelivered or not (first
attempt). The header *`CamelRedelivered`* contains a boolean if the
message is redelivered or not, which is also defined on the
*`Exchange.REDELIVERED`*.

[[DeadLetterChannel-DynamicallyCalculatedDelayFromtheExchange]]
Dynamically Calculated Delay From the Exchange
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In *Camel 2.9* and *2.8.2*: The header is *`CamelRedeliveryDelay`*,
which is also defined on the *`Exchange.REDELIVERY_DELAY`*. If this
header is absent, normal redelivery rules apply.

[[DeadLetterChannel-WhichEndpointFailed]]
Which Endpoint Failed
+++++++++++++++++++++

*Available as of Camel 2.1*

When Camel routes messages it will decorate the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] with a property that contains the *last*
endpoint Camel send the link:exchange.html[Exchange] to:

javaString lastEndpointUri = exchange.getProperty(Exchange.TO_ENDPOINT,
String.class);

The *`Exchange.TO_ENDPOINT`* have the constant value
*`CamelToEndpoint`*. This information is updated when Camel sends a
message to any endpoint. So if it exists its the *last* endpoint which
Camel send the Exchange to.

When for example processing the link:exchange.html[Exchange] at a given
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and the message is to be moved into the
dead letter queue, then Camel also decorates the Exchange with another
property that contains that *last* endpoint:

javaString failedEndpointUri =
exchange.getProperty(Exchange.FAILURE_ENDPOINT, String.class);

The *`Exchange.FAILURE_ENDPOINT`* have the constant value
*`CamelFailureEndpoint`*.

This allows for example you to fetch this information in your dead
letter queue and use that for error reporting. This is usable if the
Camel route is a bit dynamic such as the dynamic
link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] so you know which endpoints
failed.

*Note:* this information is retained on the Exchange even if the message
is subsequently processed successfully by a given endpoint only to fail,
for example, in local link:bean.html[Bean] processing instead. So,
beware that this is a hint that helps pinpoint errors.

javafrom("activemq:queue:foo") .to("http://someserver/somepath")
.beanRef("foo");

Now suppose the route above and a failure happens in the `foo` bean.
Then the *`Exchange.TO_ENDPOINT`* and *`Exchange.FAILURE_ENDPOINT`* will
still contain the value of `http://someserver/somepath`.

[[DeadLetterChannel-OnPrepareFailure]]
`OnPrepareFailure`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.16*

Before the exchange is sent to the dead letter queue, you can
use *`onPrepare`* to allow a custom *`Processor`* to prepare the
exchange, such as adding information why the Exchange failed.

For example, the following processor adds a header with the exception
message:

java public static class MyPrepareProcessor implements Processor \{
@Override public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception \{
Exception cause = exchange.getProperty(Exchange.EXCEPTION_CAUGHT,
Exception.class); exchange.getIn().setHeader("FailedBecause",
cause.getMessage()); } }

Then configure the error handler to use the processor as follows:

javaerrorHandler(deadLetterChannel("jms:dead").onPrepareFailure(new
MyPrepareProcessor()));

 

Configuring this from XML DSL is as follows:

xml<bean id="myPrepare"
class="org.apache.camel.processor.DeadLetterChannelOnPrepareTest.MyPrepareProcessor"/>
<errorHandler id="dlc" type="DeadLetterChannel" deadLetterUri="jms:dead"
onPrepareFailureRef="myPrepare"/>

 

The *`onPrepare`* is also available using the default error handler.

[[DeadLetterChannel-WhichRouteFailed]]
Which Route Failed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.10.4/2.11*

When Camel error handler handles an error such as
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] or using
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] with *`handled=true`*, then
Camel will decorate the link:exchange.html[Exchange] with the route id
where the error occurred.

Example:

javaString failedRouteId =
exchange.getProperty(Exchange.FAILURE_ROUTE_ID, String.class);

The *`Exchange.FAILURE_ROUTE_ID`* have the constant value
*`CamelFailureRouteId`*. This allows for example you to fetch this
information in your dead letter queue and use that for error reporting.

[[DeadLetterChannel-ControlifRedeliveryisAllowedDuringStopping/Shutdown]]
Control if Redelivery is Allowed During Stopping/Shutdown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.11*

Before *Camel 2.10*, Camel would perform redelivery while stopping a
route, or shutting down Camel. This has improved a bit in *Camel 2.10*:
Camel will no longer perform redelivery attempts when shutting down
aggressively, e.g., during link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful
Shutdown] and timeout hit.

From *Camel 2.11*: there is a new option
*`allowRedeliveryWhileStopping`* which you can use to control if
redelivery is allowed or not; notice that any in progress redelivery
will still be executed. This option can only disallow any redelivery to
be executed _*after*_ the stopping of a route/shutdown of Camel has been
triggered. If a redelivery is disallowed then a
*`RejectedExcutionException`* is set on the link:exchange.html[Exchange]
and the processing of the link:exchange.html[Exchange] stops. This means
any consumer will see the link:exchange.html[Exchange] as failed due the
*`RejectedExcutionException`*. The default value is *`true`* for
backward compatibility.

For example, the following snippet shows how to do this with Java DSL
and XML
DSL:\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/RedeliveryErrorHandlerNoRedeliveryOnShutdownTest.java}And
the sample sample with XML
DSL\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/SpringRedeliveryErrorHandlerNoRedeliveryOnShutdownTest.xml}

[[DeadLetterChannel-HowCanIModifytheExchangeBeforeRedelivery?]]
How Can I Modify the Exchange Before Redelivery?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We support directly in link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter
Channel] to set a link:processor.html[Processor] that is executed
*before* each redelivery attempt. When
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] is doing redeliver
its possible to configure a link:processor.html[Processor] that is
executed just *before* every redelivery attempt. This can be used for
the situations where you need to alter the message before its
redelivered. Here we configure the link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead
Letter Channel] to use our processor *`MyRedeliveryProcessor`* to be
executed before each
redelivery.\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/DeadLetterChannelOnRedeliveryTest.java}And
this is the processor *`MyRedeliveryProcessor`* where we alter the
message.\{snippet:id=e2|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/DeadLetterChannelOnRedeliveryTest.java}

[[DeadLetterChannel-HowCanILogWhatCausedtheDeadLetterChanneltobeInvoked?]]
How Can I Log What Caused the Dead Letter Channel to be Invoked?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You often need to know what went wrong that caused the Dead Letter
Channel to be used and it does not offer logging for this purpose. So
the Dead Letter Channel's endpoint can be set to a endpoint of our own
(such as *`direct:deadLetterChannel`*). We write a route to accept this
Exchange and log the Exception, then forward on to where we want the
failed Exchange moved to (which might be a DLQ queue for instance). See
