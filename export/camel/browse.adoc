Browse Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Browse component provides a simple
link:browsableendpoint.html[BrowsableEndpoint] which can be useful for
testing, visualisation tools or debugging. The exchanges sent to the
endpoint are all available to be browsed.

[[Browse-URIformat]]
URI format
^^^^^^^^^^

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
browse:someName[?options]
----

Where *someName* can be any string to uniquely identify the endpoint.

[[Browse-Sample]]
Sample
^^^^^^

In the route below, we insert a `browse:` component to be able to browse
the Exchanges that are passing through:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
  from("activemq:order.in").to("browse:orderReceived").to("bean:processOrder");
----

We can now inspect the received exchanges from within the Java code:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private CamelContext context;

    public void inspectRecievedOrders() {
        BrowsableEndpoint browse = context.getEndpoint("browse:orderReceived", BrowsableEndpoint.class);
        List<Exchange> exchanges = browse.getExchanges();
        ...
        // then we can inspect the list of received exchanges from Java
        for (Exchange exchange : exchanges) {
            String payload = exchange.getIn().getBody();
            ...
        }
   }
----
