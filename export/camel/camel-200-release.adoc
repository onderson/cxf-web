[[Camel2.0.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.0.0 release which approx 760 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Introduced link:type-converter.html[type converter registry] to allow
end users to programmatic get access to this registry
* major improvements to link:jetty.html[Jetty] for better handling of
exception/faults and easier end-user customization how response should
be written
* major improvements to link:file2.html[File] for consuming files, now
supporting pluggable sorting, filtering and idempotent repositories.
* major refactor and improvements to link:ftp2.html[FTP], aligning it
with the link:file2.html[File] component.
* minor improvements to link:jdbc.html[JDBC], link:sql.html[SQL],
link:http.html[HTTP] and link:mina.html[MINA]
* major refactor and improvements to link:cxf.html[CXF] component.Â 
CxfBinding, HeaderFilterStrategy, Bus can be looked up from registry and
configured at the endpoint level.
* link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] producers added option
to write files using a temporary name and then rename it to the real
name after the write completes
* link:ftp.html[SFTP] added support for knownhosts and privatekey files
* link:mail.html[Mail] now supports setting additional SUN java mail
properties
* link:mina.html[MINA] now supports setting text line delimiters for
textline codec.
* link:mina.html[MINA] producer now throws CamelExchangeException in
case no response received from remote server when in sync mode
(sync=true)
* RedeliveryPolicy added support for ref attribute to reference a
existing policy in the link:registry.html[Registry]
* link:dead-letter-channel.html[RedeliveryPolicy] added `delayPattern`
option for using a special pattern for setting different delay based on
intervals
* Added `onWhen` and `retryUntil` predicates to
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause]
* link:list.html[List] component renamed to link:browse.html[Browse]
* link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] is much smarter as it
will use caused by exception hierarchy for matching as well (will use
bottom ups)
* link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] and
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] now have `onRedeliver` to
allow custom processing an link:exchange.html[Exchange] *before* its
being redelivered. Allowing you to work on the message being sent.
* Added support for link:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.html[# syntax in
Endpoint URI's] to allow endpoint URI's to refer to bean in the
link:registry.html[Registry].
* `consumer.` prefix can be omitted for scheduled polling consumers such
as link:file2.html[File], link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumers. Thus the URI
options is more simpler and you don't have to remember which requires
`consumer.` prefix and which doesn't.
* link:tracer.html[Tracer] improved to allow custom routing and
processing of TraceEventMessage so you can store trace logs as you like,
for instance in a database.
* link:tracer.html[Tracer] now also displays the previous node so you
can see where the Exchange is coming from.
* link:quartz.html[Quartz] has added support for stateful jobs.
* Introduced @FallbackConverter for using annotation based fallback type
converters
* Extended link:content-enricher.html[content enrichment] support via
the link:content-enricher.html[enrich] DSL element.
* link:simple.html[Simple] language now supports a basic set of
operators.
* link:aggregator.html[Aggregator] now supports grouped exchanges out of
the box, so you can combine all aggregated exchanges into a single
grouped exchange going out.
* Multiple inputs can be define as input to routes:
`from("activemq:queue:order", "file://order").to("bean:handleOrder");`
* CXF component supports a new "cxfbean" endpoint that allows RESTful
requests to be routed to JAXRS annotated service beans.
* Setting cron expression in camel-quartz improved.
* Better handling of interrupts while shutting down.
* The JMSReplyTo destination is available as Exchange property when
consuming JMS messages.
* Better support for `InOptionalOut` Message Exchange Pattern.
* link:pluggable-class-resolvers.html[Pluggable Class Resolvers] SPI for
class resolvers allowing third party platforms such as JBoss to provide
integration with Camel.
* Refined API to reduce package tangling.
* Introduced wireTap node for the link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] EIP
pattern, supporting the traditional tapping and sending a new message.
* Added `fromF` and `toF` in the Java DSL to build uri strings using
String.format with arguments, e.g.:
`fromF("ftp://%s@myserver?password=%s", user, password)..to`
* Improved tooling being able to retrieve more runtime information from
the `CamelContext`
* Scala DSL is improved
* Added `JmsMessageType` option to link:jms.html[JMS] to allow you to
set which `javax.jms.Message` implementation to use for sending a JMS
message.
* Fixed a rare bug when JMX is disabled, a
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] could mistakenly be
added to some routes, when a global `noErrorHandler` was configured.
* link:jms.html[JMS] is now able to preserve hyphen in JMS keys (eg
Content-Type can be sent as a Message header). Introduced pluggable
strategy to allow end users to use their custom key formatter for
encode/decode.
* Added option `transferExchange` to link:jms.html[JMS] so you can
transfer the link:exchange.html[Exchange] over the wire. Can be used to
use JMS queues for link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] to
preserve all information from the failed link:exchange.html[Exchange]
including the original exception with stack trace.
* Added option `transferException` to link:jms.html[JMS] so when using
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] messaging with JMS, any caused
exception on the server side will be returned as response to the client.
* Added `rollback` as DSL keyword to force a rollback of the given
link:exchange.html[Exchange]. Does this by throwing an
`org.apache.camel.RollbackExchangeException`.
* Added SOAP Message Header filtering capability in camel-cxf component.
* ProducerTeamplate API reworked for sendBody operations to return void,
as they are InOnly. Use requestBody if you need InOut.
* Introduced `ConsumerTemplate` supporting the
link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer] EIP
* Custom endpoints with Spring @ManagedResource is now also registered
in the mbean server.
* The default error handler is changed from
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] to
link:defaulterrorhandler.html[DefaultErrorHandler].
* link:http.html[HTTP] component added option `throwException` that can
be disabled to allow failed response codes to be returned without
throwing a HttpOperationsFailedException.
* Overhaul and improvements to the link:try-catch-finally.html[Try Catch
Finally] DSLs, so they are on pair with the
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause].
* Overhaul and improvements to the link:intercept.html[Intercept] DSLs.
Added new `interceptSendToEndpoint` to intercept sending to a given
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint].
* Added the notion of a Channel in the routes.
* Added support to navigate the routes at runtime, so you can dynamic
change or affect the processors in the routes.
* Introduced a new link:async.html[Async] API for asynchronous
messaging.
* link:jetty.html[Jetty] now supports configuring Handler for e.g.
security.
* link:jetty.html[Jetty] connector can now be shared among multiple
CamelContext
* link:ibatis.html[iBATIS] added option to set `StatementType` for fine
grained control of which SqlMapClient operation to invoke. Allowing
link:ibatis.html[iBATIS] component to be used like link:sql.html[SQL] or
the link:jdbc.html[JDBC] component.
* Added link:oncompletion.html[OnCompletion] callback to
link:exchange.html[Exchange] so you can do custom routing when an
link:exchange.html[Exchange] is completed. You can for instance use it
to send an email if an link:exchange.html[Exchange] failed.
* Added link:load-balancer.html[Failover] as load balancer.
* Added `throwException` to the DSL.
* Added link:bean-binding.html[@Handler] annotation to mark a method to
be invoked when using link:bean-integration.html[POJO] in routes.
* link:predicate.html[Predicate] uses type coercion for improving
matching, thus allowing you for instance to compare a String with an
Integer, "true" with a boolean, or enum type as string etc.
* Started to standardize consumers that supported batching as a
link:batch-consumer.html[Batch Consumer].
* link:servicepool.html[Connection pooling] for link:ftp2.html[FTP] and
link:mina.html[MINA] producers. This allows thread safe concurrency
usage of these components out of the box. The connection pooling is
pluggable so you can use a 3rd party pool framework.
* Added option `fileExist` to link:file2.html[File] and
link:ftp2.html[FTP] component. This option allows you to configure what
should happen when you write a file and an existing file with that name
already exists. The link:file2.html[File] producer will now by default
*Override* existing files. In Camel 1.x it would default append.
* link:seda.html[SEDA] and link:vm.html[VM] now supports
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] and waiting for the reply if one
expected.
* Fixed issue with using 3rd party annotations and Camel annotations in
same POJO class. Now all annotations is processed by Spring.
* Added http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/jackson[Jackson] as
supported library for the link:json.html[JSON] data format.
* Simplified using link:delayer.html[Delayer] especially in Spring DSL.
* Improved link:idempotent-consumer.html[Idempotent Consumer] to eagerly
detect duplicated messages for in progress exchanges.
* Added
link:how-do-i-set-the-max-chars-when-debug-logging-messages-in-camel.html[Camel
property to set a max chars limit] for `DEBUG` logs Message bodies. To
avoid logging very big payloads. The default limit is 1000 chars.
* Configuration of http proxy is now possible with the
link:http.html[HTTP] component
* link:message-filter.html[Message Filter] EIP marks Exchanges as
filtered and is now skipped for aggregation in `AggregationStrategy` for
example used when doing link:splitter.html[Splitter] or
link:aggregator.html[Aggregator]
* link:defaulterrorhandler.html[DefaultErrorHandler] is now just as
powerful as link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] support
redelivery et. all.
* link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] will by default
*handle* exceptions.
* link:transactionerrorhandler.html[TransactionErrorHandler] is now just
as powerful as link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel]
support redelivery et. all.
* Introduced link:spring.html[`<packageScan>`] tag in camel-spring to
replace `<packages>` and it support ANT path style filtering of classes
to include/exclude.
* link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] is now default disabled.
Improved how to configure it as enabled/disabled.
* Various Camel annotations such as `@Consume` have new option `context`
to specify a particular link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] it should
apply for. Needed when you have multiple
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext].
* Major improvements to link:tracer.html[Tracer] as its now much more
fine grained and capable of tracing sub routes and all the advanced
stuff such as link:intercept.html[Intercept],
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] and
link:oncompletion.html[OnCompletion].
* Introduced link:polling-consumer.html[PollingConsumerPollStrategy] as
a pluggable strategy for scheduled consumers, allowing you to control
what should happen if an exception occurred during the initial phase of
`poll`, such as a file consumer not being able to connect to a network
drive.
* Added `pollEnrich` to DSL supporting using a
link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer] with the
link:content-enricher.html[Content Enricher] EIP pattern. This allows
you for instance to poll a file (or FTP file) during routing directly in
the DSL.
* Improved endpoint resolution to better detect similar endpoints and be
more tolerant for minor user input mistakes.
* link:ftp2.html[FTP] now supports trying to reconnect a number of times
in case a connection to the remote FTP server could not be established.
There are options to control this behavior. |
* When running in OSGi Camel will also lookup in OSGi registry when
doing link:registry.html[Registry] lookup. Will first lookup in OSGi,
and then the default link:registry.html[Registry].
* Added link:aop.html[AOP] to do custom processing before routing using
AOP concepts such as: around, before, after etc.
* link:tracer.html[Tracer], link:delay-interceptor.html[Delayer],
link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] and handle fault now has higher
granularity as you can configure it on both camel context and per route
level. Where per route will override camel context level.
* link:exchange.html[Exchange] api cleanup. Complete removal of
specialized Exchange using generics.
* Merged out and fault semantics.
* link:async.html[Async] API improved with client API that uses
callbacks that are invoked when the exchange is done allowing you to
gather the response in callbacks.
* Headers in `org.apache.camel.Message` is now case insensitive meaning
that you can lookup headers using different cased keys such as `Foo` and
`foo` will return the same value. This reduces mistakes when headers
from link:http.html[HTTP] protocols is used as they can contain
different cases.
* Performance improvements
* Fixes for link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel Maven Archetypes]
* Added SSL support to Camel link:irc.html[IRC]
* Many fixes in the link:cxf.html[CXF], link:ftp2.html[FTP],
link:log.html[Log], link:mail.html[Mail], link:jms.html[JMS] and others
* Major improvements and fixes in link:bindy.html[Bindy]
* Removed platforms specific encoding from kits
* Fixed issues related to class loading in OSGi
* link:bean.html[Bean] also supports lookup in OSGi registry
* Introduced link:spring.html[<pacakgeScan>] in Spring XML that supports
ANT path style filtering
* Introduced `PollingConsumerPollStrategy` as pluggable strategy for
fine grained error handling with link:polling-consumer.html[Polling
Consumer]
* link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] is disabled by default
* Camel using Spring DSL will automatic register a Producer and/or
ConsumerTemplate if not defined already using ids `template`,
`consumerTemplate`. Convention over configuration.

[[Camel2.0.0Release-APIbreaking]]
API breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[Camel2.0.0Release-CoreAPI]]
Core API
^^^^^^^^

[[Camel2.0.0Release-SpecializedExchange]]
Specialized Exchange
++++++++++++++++++++

All specializations of `org.apache.camel.Exchange` are now removed. You
should use `org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultExchange`. Although it looked
like a good idea initially we recognized that the specialized Exchanges
were not really necessary and by removing them we can avoid a lot of
unnecessary copying and improve throughput.

[[Camel2.0.0Release-FaultandOutConsolidation]]
Fault and Out Consolidation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The get/set Fault apis on the Exchange are now removed. Faults represent
application specific errors and are recognized by some protocols. As a
result Camel treats faults as out in an exchange. The
`org.apache.camel.Message` interface has not a get/setFault(boolean) api
to identify out messages that represent in fact a fault. +
Since Faults represent persistent errors (as opposed to exceptions that
represent transient errors) Camel does not try (as in previous versions)
to recover from them (i.e. the error handler does not trigger) unless
handling faults as exceptions is explicitly enabled.

[[Camel2.0.0Release-Exchangecopy()api]]
Exchange copy() api
+++++++++++++++++++

We also consolidated redundant copy related apis in
`org.apache.camel.Exchange` as they were pretty much doing the same
thing. The following two apis were removed `newInstance()`,
`copyFrom(Exchange)`. `copy(boolean)` found a better home at
`org.apache.camel.util.ExchangeHelper`.

[[Camel2.0.0Release-ClientAPI]]
Client API
^^^^^^^^^^

[[Camel2.0.0Release-Routes]]
Routes
++++++

The `org.apache.camel.Routes` interface have been renamed to
`org.apache.camel.RoutesBuilder` and having a more precise and simpler
interface. +
This only affects advanced users that implement their own route builder
integration with Camel from a foreign languages such as Ruby etc.

[[Camel2.0.0Release-StreamCache]]
StreamCache
+++++++++++

link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] is now default disabled. If you
use streams and want Camel to cache the stream in case you for instance
use Camel to do redeliveries then you must enable stream cache so the
stream can be re-read on delivery.

[[Camel2.0.0Release-AggregationStrategy]]
AggregationStrategy
+++++++++++++++++++

The payload is now *always* only stored in `IN` when you do custom
aggregation using this strategy interface. +
Before the payload could also be in `OUT` and it could be confusing
where to get the real payload you should use.

[[Camel2.0.0Release-ProducerTemplate]]
ProducerTemplate
++++++++++++++++

The sendBody methods now return void for InOnly messaging. Use
requestBody if you want InOut messaging.

[[Camel2.0.0Release-AggregationStrategy.1]]
AggregationStrategy
+++++++++++++++++++

The aggregate method is now also invoked on the very first exchange.
Allowing the end users to be in full power. +
At this first invocation the `oldExchange` parameter is `null`.

[[Camel2.0.0Release-NotablechangestoDSL]]
Notable changes to DSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Renamed DSL operations
** splitter -> split
** resequencer -> resequence
** aggregator -> aggregate
** delayer -> delay
** throttler -> throttle
** expression -> language
** try (Spring DSL) -> doTry
** catch (Spring DSL) -> doCatch
** finally (Spring DSL) -> doFinally
** tryBlock (Java DSL) -> doTry
** handle (Java DSL) -> doCatch
** finallyBlock (Java DSL) -> doFinally
** intercept -> interceptFrom
** thread -> threads
** throwFault has been removed, you can set a the fault using the
`exchange.setFault` method

* Renamed DSL in SpringBuilder
** bean -> lookup

[[Camel2.0.0Release-Components]]
Components
^^^^^^^^^^

* The link:list.html[List] component is renamed to
link:browse.html[Browse] component
* The link:queue.html[Queue] component has been removed
* The link:ftp2.html[FTP] component have renamed some of its URI options
* The link:file2.html[File] component have renamed some of its URI
options
* The link:cxf.html[CXF] component have been refactored and APIs have
been simplified

[[Camel2.0.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

See known issues from previous releases.

If you have multiple link:mail.html[Mail] endpoints and defined
recipients on these endpoints, Camel could mixup and only use the
recipients defined on the last endpoint. See more at CAMEL-2232.

[[Camel2.0.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you specialized existing components and used specialized
`org.apache.camel.Exchange` classes, your code will need updating to use
`org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultExchange` instead.

The default error handler is no longer
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] but
link:defaulterrorhandler.html[DefaultErrorHandler] that by default do
not try to redeliver.
