Camel uses a Java based link:dsl.html[Routing Domain Specific Language
(DSL)] or an link:xml-configuration.html[Xml Configuration] to configure
link:routes.html[routing and mediation rules] which are added to a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/CamelContext.html[CamelContext]
to implement the various
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns].

At a high level Camel consists of a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/CamelContext.html[CamelContext]
which contains a collection of link:component.html[Component] instances.
A link:component.html[Component] is essentially a factory of
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] instances. You can explicitly configure
link:component.html[Component] instances in Java code or an IoC
container like Spring or Guice, or they can be auto-discovered using
link:uris.html[URIs].

An link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] acts rather like a URI or URL in a web
application or a Destination in a JMS system; you can communicate with
an endpoint; either sending messages to it or consuming messages from
it. You can then create a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Producer.html[Producer]
or
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Consumer.html[Consumer]
on an link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] to exchange messages with it.

The link:dsl.html[DSL] makes heavy use of pluggable
link:languages.html[Languages] to create an
link:expression.html[Expression] or link:predicate.html[Predicate] to
make a truly powerful DSL which is extensible to the most suitable
language depending on your needs. The following languages are supported

* link:bean-language.html[Bean Language] for using Java for expressions
* link:constant.html[Constant]
* the unified link:el.html[EL] from JSP and JSF
* link:header.html[Header]
* link:jsonpath.html[JSonPath]
* link:jxpath.html[JXPath]
* link:mvel.html[Mvel]
* link:ognl.html[OGNL]
* link:ref-language.html[Ref Language]
* link:exchangeproperty.html[ExchangeProperty]
/Â link:property.html[Property]
* link:scripting-languages.html[Scripting Languages] such as
** link:beanshell.html[BeanShell]
** link:javascript.html[JavaScript]
** link:groovy.html[Groovy]
** link:python.html[Python]
** link:php.html[PHP]
** link:ruby.html[Ruby]
* link:simple.html[Simple]
** link:file-language.html[File Language]
* link:spel.html[Spring Expression Language]
* link:sql.html[SQL]
* link:tokenizer.html[Tokenizer]
* link:xpath.html[XPath]
* link:xquery.html[XQuery]
* link:vtd-xml.html[VTD-XML]

Most of these languages is also supported used as
link:annotation-based-expression-language.html[Annotation Based
Expression Language].
