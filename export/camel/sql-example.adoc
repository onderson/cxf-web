*Available as of Camel 2.11*

This example is located in the `examples/camel-example-sql` directory of
the Camel distribution. +
There is a `README.txt` file with instructions how to run it.

If you use maven then you can easily compile and install the example
from the command line:

mvn install

[[SQLExample-About]]
About
^^^^^

This example shows how to exchange data using a shared database table.

The example has two Camel routes. The first route insert new data into
the table, triggered by a timer to run every 5th second. +
The second route pickup the newly inserted rows from the table, process
the row(s), and mark the row(s) as processed when done; to avoid picking
up the same rows again.

[[SQLExample-Implementation]]
Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the `camel-context.xml` file in the
`src/main/resources/META-INF/spring` folder we have the Spring XML file
to setup and configure the database, as well the
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext].

\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|title=Setting up
database|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-sql/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/camel-context.xml}

And then in the same file we setup our Camel application. At first we
have a orderBean that we use in the routes to generate new orders and
process orders as well.

\{snippet:id=e2|lang=xml|title=Camel
application|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-sql/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/camel-context.xml}

Notice how we have externalized the SQL queries, and use Camels
link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[property placeholder] to refer to
the `sql.properties` file.

Using named query parameters

Notice in the SQL queries below we use named parameters which must start
with prefix ':#' and then the name, eg :#amount. Then Camel will bind
that parameter with the given name, from the +
message body (if its a `java.util.Map`) or from a message header with
the name. If none parameter could be found, Camel throws an exception.
