[[Camel1.3.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please be aware of the cacheLevelName setting when using the
link:jms.html[JMS] and link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ] components; the
defaults have changed recently to work around some bugs in Spring that
are fixed in version 2.5.x. Please refer to the warnings on the
link:jms.html[JMS page] for more details.

There is an issue in link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] if you have
configured 2 or more exception clauses. Camel picks the first clause
that is an instance of the thrown exception. Chances are that if you
have configued a top level clause such as java.lang.Exception that Camel
could pick this clause over a more specialized clause such as
java.io.Exception for network related issues. The issue is reported in
CAMEL-410.
