Service Activator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel has several endpoint components that support the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessagingAdapter.html[Service
Activator] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns].

Components like link:bean.html[Bean], link:cxf.html[CXF] and
link:pojo.html[Pojo] provide a a way to bind the message exchange to a
Java interface/service where the route defines the endpoints and wires
it up to the bean.

In addition you can use the link:bean-integration.html[Bean Integration]
to wire messages to a bean using annotation.

Here is a simple example of using a link:direct.html[Direct] endpoint to
create a messaging interface to a link:pojo.html[Pojo]
link:bean.html[Bean] service.

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("direct:invokeMyService").to("bean:myService");
----

*Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
    <from uri="direct:invokeMyService"/>
    <to uri="bean:myService"/>
</route>

[[ServiceActivator-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
