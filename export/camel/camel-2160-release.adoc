[[Camel2.16.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.16.0 release which approx 600 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

Noteworthy improvements:

* The route models (definition classes) preserve property placeholders,
which allows round trip editing, and also prevents showing potential
sensitive information
* Added onPrepareFailure option to link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead
Letter Channel] to allow a custom processor to prepare the Exchange
before sending to the dead letter queue.
* link:mongodb.html[MongoDB] tailable consumers now allow setting the
`readPreference` option.
* Using setFaultBody / setFaultHeader behaves similar to setBody /
setHeader to preserve existing headers/attachments by setting on
existing IN or OUT message.
* Java DSL using choice with end vs endChoice now validates you use them
as intended. Any misconfiguration now throws an exception explaining the
problem.
* link:pojo-producing.html[POJO Producing]
and link:pojo-consuming.html[POJO Consuming] lifecycle is now in sync
with link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] which ensures it works as
similar to Camel link:routes.html[Routes] does. Also the created
producer/consumer is stopped
when link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] is stopping to cleanup
properly.
* link:jms.html[JMS] component now allows configuring
concurrentConsumers/maxConcurrentConsumers separately between from(jms)
vs to(jms) using request/reply over JMS
*  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8506[Added SEARCH]
operation to Elasticsearch component
* The link:properties.html[Properties] component (property placeholder)
now supports an encoding option to allow reading the .properties files
using a specific charset such as UTF-8. By default ISO-8859-1 is used
(latin1)
* Added `receviveBufferSize` option to the link:ftp.html[FTP] component
to make download faster. The size is by default 32kb buffer.
* The link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator2] EIP now allows an external
source using a `AggregateController` to control the aggregator, such as
for forcing completing a group or all groups, or query runtime
information from the aggregator. A default controller is provided out of
the box if none has been configured.
* The link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator2] now enlists in JMX using
a `ManagedAggregateProcessorMBean` which has more information, and also
allows using the aggregate controller to control it.
* The link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator2] now includes more runtime
statistics which can be accessed from Java and JMX about number of
incoming and completed exchanges, and per different completion triggers.
* The link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator2] now supports pre-completion
mode if the aggregation strategy
implements `PreCompletionAwareAggregationStrategy`. This supports the
use-case where an incoming Exchange are used to determine if the current
aggregated group is completed or not. If completed the group is emitted
as-is, and the new incoming Exchange is used to start a new group from
scratch.
* Added options to link:mail.html[Mail] consumer so it can skip or
handle a mail message that cannot be read from the mail server in the
batch; and then move on to read the next message. This ensures the
consumer can deal with mail boxes that has problematic mails that
otherwise will cause no mails to be retrieve by the consumer in the
batch.
* The runtime route processors and their corresponding model definition
are now linked by their id using `HasId`, so its easier to obtain the
processor or model definition from the `getProcessor(id)` and
`getProcessorDefintion(id)` api on CamelContext.
* CamelContext now also includes a getManagedProcessor API to easily get
the mbean client api for the processor, so you can access the runtime
JMX statistics from Java code. 
*  link:spring-boot.html[Spring Boot] applications now
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8532[block the main thread
of the execution]
*  link:spring-boot.html[Spring Boot] automagically
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8523[loads XML routes
definitions] from classpath
* Added `MainListener` to make it easier for Camel Boot / Standalone
Camel to implement custom logic to trigger during the starting and
stopping of the application.
*  Camel Jackson now provides
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8554[`Map` to `Object`
converter]
* Ability to refer to existing hazelcast instance by id,
using link:hazelcast-component.html[Hazelcast Component]
* link:direct.html[Direct] and link:direct-vm.html[Direct-VM] now
supports the failIfNoConsumers option
* Making it easier to add custom link:type-converter.html[Type
Converter] to your Camel applications without having to use the META-INF
file. In Spring or Blueprint just add them as <bean>s. See more details
at link:type-converter.html[Type Converter] documentation.
* camel-cxf PAYLOAD supports stream cache out of box.
* `BridgePropertyPlaceholderConfigurer` supports to handle the
link:jasypt.html[jasypt]encryption inside and outside of the
camelContext.
* The camel-aws component now support Amazon DynamoDB version 2 +
* The link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] eip now also emits event
notifications when sending the Exchange to the wire tap destination
* link:camel-test.html[Camel Test] has new option isDumpRouteStats that
dumps all route usage statistics as XML files in
target/camel-route-stats directory, which can be used to inspect "route
coverage" reports.
* Now link:netty4.html[Camel Netty] component doesn't intercept
consumers with `httpMethodRestrict=OPTIONS`
* Now link:netty4-http.html[Netty HTTP] resolves OPTIONS prefix matches
earlier
* Using link:load-balancer.html[Load Balancer] with Java DSL now builds
the route model using the specific model types, which renders a more
accurate route model
* Enhanced the PredicateBuilder to support vargs and list in the "or"
builder method
* Using custom `HttpBinding` with link:http.html[HTTP]
and link:http4.html[HTTP4] is now easier as they can be instantiated
using a default no-arg constructor
* Added `readLock=idempotent` to the link:file2.html[File2] consumer
which allows to reuse an idempotent repository as read-lock which
enables Camel to run reliable in clustered mode, where each node
competes for the same files from a shared file system. This requires
that the idempotent repository supports clustering such
as link:hazelcast-component.html[Hazelcast Component]
or link:infinispan.html[Infinispan] - or using the JDBC for a shared
database table.
* link:rx.html[Camel RX] now ensures that observe and subscribe are done
within an unit of work to ensure on completions is executed, such as
they are done when you use regular Camel routes.
* The link:jms.html[JMS] component now includes the
underlying `javax.jms.Session` instance on the Camel message which
allows end users to easier to use client acknowledge mode, in case the
client wants to use the session to call recover or rollback.
* Added `completionEager` option
to link:idempotent-consumer.html[Idempotent Consumer] to whether to
complete the idempotent consumer eager or when the exchange is done.
* Working with the Camel source code in Eclipse with m2eclipse plugin
improved to avoid endless file changed detection and recompile the
source.
* Add option `suppressExceptions` to link:jsonpath.html[JSonPath] which
allows to ignore exceptions such as NoSuchPathException when the json
payload does not contain the path defined in the json expression.
* link:spring-boot.html[Spring Boot] now creates `CamelContext`,
`ProducerTemplate` and `ConsumerTemplate` beans only if those are not
defined by the user.  
* New `camel-archetype-spring-boot` to create a new Camel Spring Boot
project using Maven.
* New `camel-archetype-cdi` to create a new Camel CDI project using
Maven.
* link:ftp2.html[FTP2] doesn't support absolute directories in endpoint
URIs. In such cases, paths will be treated as relative and WARN message
will be printed in logs. In future versions, there'll be no such
assumption and validation exception will be thrown instead.
* link:swagger.html[Swagger] module now supports getting api-docs from
multiple camel contexts in the JVM. The entry point at /api-docs now
lists the contexts detected, and you need to append the context id in
the path, eg /api-docs/myCamel
* link:ftp2.html[FTP2] supports `autoCreate=true` for ftp consumers
* link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL] now supports to define parameter using
fine grained details for the link:swagger.html[Swagger] api
documentation. For an example see
the `camel-example-servlet-rest-tomcat` in the Apache Camel
distribution.
* The link:simple.html[Simple] language now has a equals ignore case
operator (=~) when comparing with string values 
* If using <contextScan> with Spring or Blueprint to filter RouteBuilder
classes, then Camel will now by default only look for singleton beans.
You can turn on the old behavior to include prototype scoped with the
new option 
+
....
includeNonSingletons
....
* The
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/spi/IdempotentRepository.html[IdempotentRepository]
now supports clear operation, to clear the repository, and expose it
over JMX.
* link:netty4.html[Netty4] in clientMode will now automatic re-connect
if the connection was disconnected to the server.
* The `throwException` EIP now supports creating a new exception
instance from a simple language expressions, which allows to make it
dynamic based on information from the current Exchange.
* When using link:expression.html[Expression]
or link:predicate.html[Predicate] in the routes, you can refer to the
value as an external resource by using *resource:classpath:path* or
*resource:file:path* - for example
`resource:classpath:com/foo/myscript.groovy`.
* Added option useMessageBodyForSql to the link:sql-component.html[SQL
Component] which allows to use more dynamic SQL queries instead of the
fixed SQL defined in the endpoint uri.
* Added sticky option to failover link:load-balancer.html[Load Balancer]
so the load balancer can start from the last known good endpoint.
* Added option `shareUnitOfWork` to link:content-enricher.html[Content
Enricher] eip
* link:content-enricher.html[Content Enricher] with enrich and
pollEnrich now supports dynamic endpoint uris computed using
an link:expression.html[Expression] that allows to use values from the
current link:exchange.html[Exchange] so you for example can poll a file
which name is computed from data from the link:exchange.html[Exchange]
etc. This change breaks the XML DSL a little bit and there is an easy
migration effort. The Java DSL stays backwards compatible.
* The Camel Karaf commands about routes now no longer require the
context-id as 2nd parameter that is optional - if none provided then the
command is a bulk operation for all Camel contexts.
* A simpler version of dynamic to with the new <toD> and toD in the DSL,
documented at link:message-endpoint.html[Message Endpoint]
* link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] now supports dynamic endpoint uris, in
similar way the new <toD> and toD does
* link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL] now supports the new <toD> and toD in the
rest-dsl.
* The link:eip.html[EIP]'s now have more specialized processor mbeans
in link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] and you can also dump the processor as
xml source to represent how it would _appear in xml dsl_ 
* Configuring link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] using JVM system properties
now all take precedence over any existing configuration (some option was
not doing that)
* Introduced Extended JMX statistics level to gather additional metrics
during runtime.
* All the link:aws.html[Camel-AWS] components now support the definition
(through URI options) of Proxy Host and Proxy Port.
* The HTTP based consumers no longer include Camel headers in the
responses by default (they already did this for the producers to not
include Camel headers when calling a HTTP service).
* link:bindy.html[Bindy] now supports having multiple pojos as models in
the same java package. Instead of configuring using package names, you
configure using class names.
* You can configure on the link:type-converter.html[Type Converter]
registry what should happen if a duplicate type converter is being added
(override, ignore or fail) as well configure the logging level.
* link:using-camelproxy.html[Using CamelProxy] now binds the method
parameters to the message body/header using Camel annotations to define
the binding rules. If no annotations is defined the the parameter is
assumed the message body. You can turn this off to have the old
behavior.
* link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX] using custom JMX operations/attributes
with `@ManagedResource` now also includes the default set of JMX from
Camel, so you have both worlds.
* Added `completeAllOnStop` option to link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator2]
to allow to complete all pending exchanges from the aggregation
repository when stopping. For example when using a memory based
repository to ensure all of those exchanges are processed when stopping.
* Allow to configure the OK status code ranges
for link:http.html[HTTP], link:http4.html[HTTP4], link:netty-http.html[Netty
HTTP], link:netty4-http.html[Netty4 HTTP], and link:jetty.html[Jetty]
components for their producers. The default range is 200-299.
* Now link:vertx.html[Vert.x] endpoints
support https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8987[multiple
consumers]. 
* Support for TAR files: marshalling and unmarshalling via a data
format; splitting; aggregating. See _Data Formats_ section below.
* link:sjms.html[SJMS] component has been aligned to bind between Camel
Message and JMS Message in the same way as link:jms.html[JMS] component
does that.
* Added failsafe check to ensure link:jms.html[JMS] consumer will no
longer send back a reply message to the same destination as itself to
avoid endless loop. There is an option to turn this off in case you know
what you are doing.
* The link:hazelcast-component.html[Camel-hazelcast] component now
supports the Ringbuffer data structure.
* New XSLT Aggregation Strategy to merge two messages with an XSLT file.
See
https://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/util/toolbox/XsltAggregationStrategy.html[javadoc]
_(link valid once this release is published)_. It is also accessible
from the toolbox: `AggregationStrategies.xslt()`.
* A pure Java based link:swagger.html[Swagger] component that also
supports any JVM (standalone, war, jee, spring boot, et all) as the
platform for API of the Camel link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL]. (previously
a servlet was required).
* link:data-format.html[Data Format]'s is now also enlisted in JMX under
the dataformats group (requires the data format implementation is a
Camel `Service)`
* Configuring context-path in link:rest-dsl.html[Rest DSL] will now use
the context-path when creating the http server (except for servlet as
servlet urls are relative)
* OptaPlanner compoent extended to support async solving, daemon mode
and ProblemFactChange processing

Fixed the following issues:

* File language now properly supports file extensions having double
dots, such as .tar.gz
* Fixed issue with doTry not stopping routing if a fault message was set
using setFaultBody within the doTry.
* Fixed link:bean.html[Bean] language to support end parenthesis in
quoted string literals as part of method parameters, and not as end of
method signature. 
* Fixed link:ftp2.html[FTP2] using `pollEnrich` with disconnect=true and
delete=true, would disconnect before deleting the file. Now we
disconnect last.
* Various EIPs such
as link:splitter.html[Splitter], link:recipient-list.html[Recipient
List], link:multicast.html[Multicast] no longer reuse message id in
their sub messages, but each sub message has its own unique message id
(just as the exchange has).
* Fixed an issue with the circuit breaker link:load-balancer.html[Load
Balancer] not honoring the half open after period after an error was
detected.
* Fixed link:ftp2.html[FTP2] now calling disconnect if there was no
messages to poll, even when disconnect=true configured.
* Fixed link:throttler.html[Throttler] using method call expression in
XML DSL was not working
* Fixed stopping a route may stop context scoped OnException that would
otherwise send message to an endpoint, now been stopped and an
IllegalStateException was thrown while handling the exception.
* Fixed using a link:load-balancer.html[Load Balancer] from a context
scoped onException may double up its processors participating in the
balancer per route in the context.
* Fixed `parallelAggregate` on multicast/splitter/recipient list to use
a thread pool for running concurrently. 
* Fixed link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] to not delete data that
was spooled to disk before both exchanges are done routing.
* Fixed link:defaulterrorhandler.html[DefaultErrorHandler] to use 1 sec
redelivery delay out of the box as the other error handlers does. 
* Fixed setting `logExhaustedMessageHistory=true`
on link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] to log the message
history. This option is by default false on DLC as it would be as before
(not noisy).
* Fixed double refresh of the parent Spring Boot Application Context
* Fixed configuring endpoint uri's with primitive types when the value
is looked up in the registry using #notation would not work.
* Fixed using transacted in the Scala DSL
* camel-swagger now filters out older Camel releases that do not support
rest-dsl when it discovers Camel's in the JVM
* Fixed link:mail.html[Mail] consumer to use the default value of 60
seconds as poll interval again, instead of 0.5 sec.
* Fixed link:netty.html[Netty] and link:netty4.html[Netty4] may perform
x2 redelivery when attempting to redeliver to a netty producer endpoint
* Fixed link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] would not work if using
RAW() syntax in endpoint uri
* Fixed Camel Commands to not show correct route status for suspended
routes in the routes-list command.
* Fixed using link:http.html[HTTP] and `Exchange.HTTP_QUERY` or
`Exchange.HTTP_URI` may double encode the value.
* Fixed starting a route from a file endpoint, and then do
a `pollEnrich` from another file endpoint, and both using the same
readLock=marker, would only delete one of the marker files when done.
* Fixed  link:jgroups.html[JGroups]  managed routes starting too early.
* Fixed link:http4.html[HTTP4], link:http.html[HTTP],
link:netty4-http.html[Netty4 HTTP], link:netty-http.html[Netty HTTP]
producers forming URLs badly when using Exchange.HTTP_PATH and query
parameters inside the endpoint URI.
* Fixed link:mqtt.html[MQTT] receiving duplicates in some cases when the
connection to the broker was lost.
* Fixed link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip]
and link:dynamic-router.html[Dynamic Router] to not evaluate expression
again during each redelivery attempt from link:error-handler.html[Error
Handler] if routing caused an exception.
* Fixed a JMX leak where FTP producers was not unregistered from JMX
when their routes are removed.
* Fixed suspend/resume link:seda.html[SEDA] routes may in rare cases not
poll new messages from the seda queue when resumed.

API breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  org.apache.camel.mode.LoadBalancerDefinition no longer implements
org.apache.camel.processor.loadbalancer.LoadBalancer which is the
runtime processor (this was never intended).
* The `ref` attribute on `<loadBalance>` has been removed, as it has
been deprecated for a long time, and you should use
a `<customLoadBalancer>` to refer to a custom load balancer.
* The `copy` method on `StreamCache` now takes an `Exchange` as
parameter.
* Various APIs in `camel-jms` has been adjusted to support including the
JMS session parameter - `javax.jms.Session`. Though these API changes
are mostly internal facing, and we do not expect end users problems.
* The `resourceUri` and `resourceRef` attributes on `<enrich>`
and `<pollEnrich>` has been removed as they now support a dynamic uris
computed from an link:expression.html[Expression].
* Various APIs from camel-http in the
package `org.apache.camel.component.http` has been moved to the
camel-http-common module in the package `org.apache.camel.http.common`
which mean you may need to change the imports.
* Renamed `All` enum on `org.apache.camel.ManagementStatisticsLevel`
to `Default` 
* Added new boolean parameter to method
on `org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownPrepared`
* Added configure method to allowing configuring CamelContext on
`org.apache.camel.main.MainListener`

[[Camel2.16.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The dumpRoutesAsXml operation now preserve property placeholder used
in the route models. 
* Using setFaultBody / setFaultHeader behaves similar to setBody /
setHeader to preserve existing headers/attachments by setting on
existing IN or OUT message.
* If using concurrent consumer on link:jms.html[JMS] endpoints for
request/reply over JMS then you must use the new
replyToConcurrentConsumers, replyToMaxConcurrentConsumers options to
configure the values. 
* When the link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator2] is forced completed the
exchange property `Exchange.AGGREGATED_COMPLETED_BY` value has been
changed from "forceCompletion" to "force" so its named like the other
completion triggers.
* Removed unsupported modules camel-web and camel-web-standalone.
* Removed unsupported camel:dot functionality from camel:run plugin.
* Removed unsupported camel-archetype-scala-component from maven
archetypes.
* The Maven coordinate for linkedin and olingo2 components changed to be
aligned like all the others having groupId as just org.apache.camel.
* If using MongoDB component, the option _invokeGetLastError_ doesn't
exist anymore. The option invokeGetLastError instructs the MongoDB Java
driver to invoke _getLastError()_ after every call. In the 3.0.0 MongoDB
driver implementation, the _getLastError()_ method in WriteResult has
been removed. So, if needed, use an acknowledged WriteConcern when
executing the write operation and then verify the correctness of the
operation with the method _wasAcknowledged()_ of WriteResult.
* The link:jing.html[Jing] component now uses `jing` as schema name in
uris, instead of `rng` or `rnc`. Those names has been removed.
* link:swagger.html[Swagger] module now supports getting api-docs from
multiple camel contexts in the JVM. The entry point at /api-docs now
lists the contexts detected, and you need to append the context id in
the path, eg /api-docs/myCamel
* If using <contextScan> with Spring or Blueprint to filter RouteBuilder
classes, then Camel will now by default only look for singleton beans.
You can turn on the old behavior to include prototype scoped with the
new option 
+
....
includeNonSingletons
....
* camel-vertx has been upgraded to vertx 3.0 which requires Java 8 at
runtime.
* `camel-cdi` is now using CDI 1.1 api - support for 1.0 has been
dropped.
* link:content-enricher.html[Content Enricher] with enrich and
pollEnrich now supports dynamic endpoint uris computed using
an link:expression.html[Expression] that allows to use values from the
current link:exchange.html[Exchange] so you for example can poll a file
which name is computed from data from the link:exchange.html[Exchange]
etc. This change breaks the XML DSL a little bit and there is an easy
migration effort. The Java DSL stays backwards compatible.
* link:wire-tap.html[WireTap] now supports dynamic endpoint uris
computed using an link:expression.html[Expression] that allows to use
values from the current link:exchange.html[Exchange] so you for example
can tap to endpoints based on the content from the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] etc. This change breaks the XML DSL a
little bit and there is an easy migration effort. The Java DSL stays
backwards compatible.
* Support for CXF 2.7 is dropped.
* camel-jetty8 is being considered deprecated and we would like to drop
this in a nearby future release as Jetty 8.x is EOL. 
* If you have explicit configured the JMX statistics level to All then
that option is now called Default. 
* The HTTP based consumers no longer include Camel headers in the
responses by default (they already did this for the producers to not
include Camel headers when calling a HTTP service).
* link:bindy.html[Bindy] requires to be configured using class names
instead of package names, as it now supports having multiple model
classes in the same java packages now.
* link:using-camelproxy.html[Using CamelProxy] now binds the method
parameters to the message body/header using Camel annotations to define
the binding rules. If no annotations is defined the the parameter is
assumed the message body. You can turn this off to have the old
behavior.
* link:sjms.html[SJMS] component has been aligned to bind between Camel
Message and JMS Message in the same way as link:jms.html[JMS] component
does that, in the process a few APIs and behavior has been changed.
* `DefaultExchangeHolder` now only keep primitive / String type headers
/ exchange properties (like JMS component) and filter out other types
such as java instances (caught exception on exchange property is kept as
well).
* The Scala based link:swagger.html[Swagger] (camel-swagger) is
deprecated in favor of the new camel-swagger-java component.
* The camel-ruby feature has been removed, use camel-script-jruby
instead.
* The camel-jetty component is upgraded to Jetty 9, use camel-jetty8 if
you need to use Jetty 8.
* camel-jetty8 is deprecated as Jetty 8 is EOL.
