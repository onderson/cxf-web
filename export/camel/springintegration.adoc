Spring Integration Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *spring-integration:* component provides a bridge for Camel
components to talk to
http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration[spring integration
endpoints].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

xml <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
<artifactId>camel-spring-integration</artifactId>
<version>x.x.x</version> <!-- use the same version as your Camel core
version --> </dependency>

[[SpringIntegration-URIformat]]
URI format
^^^^^^^^^^

spring-integration:defaultChannelName[?options]

Where *defaultChannelName* represents the default channel name which is
used by the Spring Integration Spring context. It will equal to the
`inputChannel` name for the Spring Integration consumer and the
`outputChannel` name for the Spring Integration provider.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

|=======================================================================
|Name |Type |Description
|`inputChannel` |String |The Spring integration input channel name that
this endpoint wants to consume from, where the specified channel name is
defined in the Spring context.

|`outputChannel` |String |The Spring integration output channel name
that is used to send messages to the Spring integration context.

|`inOut` |String |The exchange pattern that the Spring integration
endpoint should use. If `inOut=true` then a reply channel is expected,
either from the Spring Integration Message header or configured on the
endpoint.

[[SpringIntegration-Usage]]
Usage
^^^^^

The Spring integration component is a bridge that connects Camel
endpoints with Spring integration endpoints through the Spring
integration's input channels and output channels. Using this component,
we can send Camel messages to Spring Integration endpoints or receive
messages from Spring integration endpoints in a Camel routing context.

Examples

[[SpringIntegration-UsingtheSpringintegrationendpoint]]
Using the Spring integration endpoint
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can set up a Spring integration endpoint using a URI, as follows:

\{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring-integration/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/spring/integration/producer.xml}
\{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring-integration/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/spring/integration/twoWayConsumer.xml}

Or directly using a Spring integration channel name:

\{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring-integration/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/spring/integration/springChannelConverter.xml}

[[SpringIntegration-TheSourceandTargetadapter]]
The Source and Target adapter
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Spring integration also provides the Spring integration's source and
target adapters, which can route messages from a Spring integration
channel to a Camel endpoint or from a Camel endpoint to a Spring
integration channel.

This example uses the following namespaces:

\{snippet:id=header|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring-integration/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/spring/integration/adapter/CamelTarget.xml}

You can bind your source or target to a Camel endpoint as follows:

\{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring-integration/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/spring/integration/adapter/CamelTarget.xml}
\{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring-integration/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/component/spring/integration/adapter/CamelSource.xml}
