Routing Slip
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/RoutingTable.html[Routing
Slip] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP patterns]
allows you to route a message consecutively through a series of
processing steps where the sequence of steps is not known at design time
and can vary for each message.

|=======================================================================
|Name |Default Value |Description
|`uriDelimiter` |`,` |Delimiter used if the
link:expression.html[Expression] returned multiple endpoints.

|`ignoreInvalidEndpoints` |`false` a|
If an endpoint URI could not be resolved, should it be ignored.

Otherwise, Camel will throw an exception stating the endpoint URI is not
valid.

|`cacheSize` |`1000` a|
*Camel 2.13.1/2.12.4:* Allows to configure the cache size for the
*`ProducerCache`* which caches producers for reuse in the routing slip.

The default cache size is *`1000`*.

A value of *`-1`* disables the use of the cache.

[[RoutingSlip-Example]]
Example
+++++++

The following route will take any messages sent to the
http://activemq.apache.org[Apache ActiveMQ] queue *`SomeQueue`* and pass
them into the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/RoutingTable.html[Routing
Slip] pattern.

javafrom("activemq:SomeQueue") .routingSlip("aRoutingSlipHeader");

Messages will be checked for the existence of the *`aRoutingSlipHeader`*
header. The value of this header should be a comma-delimited list of
endpoint link:uris.html[URIs] you wish the message to be routed to. The
link:message.html[Message] will be routed in a
link:pipes-and-filters.html[pipeline] fashion, i.e., one after the
other. From *Camel 2.5* the link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip] will
set a property, *`Exchange.SLIP_ENDPOINT`*, on the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] which contains the current endpoint as it
advanced though the slip. This allows you to _know_ how far we have
processed in the slip.

The link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip] will compute the slip
*beforehand* which means, the slip is only computed once. If you need to
compute the slip _on-the-fly_ then use the
link:dynamic-router.html[Dynamic Router] pattern instead.

[[RoutingSlip-ConfigurationOptions]]
Configuration Options
+++++++++++++++++++++

Here we set the header name and the URI delimiter to something
different.

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent
Builders]*\{snippet:id=e3|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/routingslip/RoutingSlipTest.java}*Using
the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]*

<camelContext id="buildRoutingSlip"
xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring"> <route> <from
uri="direct:c"/> <routingSlip uriDelimiter="#">
<header>aRoutingSlipHeader</header> </routingSlip> </route>
</camelContext>

[[RoutingSlip-IgnoreInvalidEndpoints]]
Ignore Invalid Endpoints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.3*

The link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip] now supports
*`ignoreInvalidEndpoints`* which the link:recipient-list.html[Recipient
List] also supports. You can use it to skip endpoints which are invalid.

javafrom("direct:a") .routingSlip("myHeader") .ignoreInvalidEndpoints();

And in Spring XML its an attribute on the recipient list tag:

xml<route> <from uri="direct:a"/> <routingSlip
ignoreInvalidEndpoints="true"/> <header>myHeader</header> </routingSlip>
</route>

Then let's say the *`myHeader`* contains the following two endpoints
*`direct:foo,xxx:bar`*. The first endpoint is valid and works. However
the second endpoint is invalid and will just be ignored. Camel logs
at *`INFO`* level, so you can see why the endpoint was invalid.

[[RoutingSlip-ExpressionSupport]]
Expression Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.4*

The link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip] now supports to take the
expression parameter as the link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List]
does. You can tell Camel the expression that you want to use to get the
routing slip.

javafrom("direct:a") .routingSlip(header("myHeader"))
.ignoreInvalidEndpoints();

And in Spring XML its an attribute on the recipient list tag.

xml<route> <from uri="direct:a"/> <!--NOTE from Camel 2.4.0, you need to
specify the expression element inside of the routingSlip element -->
<routingSlip ignoreInvalidEndpoints="true"> <header>myHeader</header>
</routingSlip> </route>
