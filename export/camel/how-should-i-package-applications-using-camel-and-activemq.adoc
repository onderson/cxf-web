How should I package applications using Camel and ActiveMQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So you may wish to use Camel's
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=60892[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] inside the ActiveMQ Broker. In which case the
stand alone broker is already packaged to work with Camel out of the
box; just add your EIP routing rules to ActiveMQ's
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=35879[Xml
Configuration] like the example routing rule which ships with ActiveMQ
5.x or later. If you want to include some Java routing rules, then just
add your jar to somewhere inside ActiveMQ's lib directory.

If you wish to use ActiveMQ and/or Camel in a standalone application, we
recommend you just create a normal Spring application; then add the
necessary jars and customise the Spring XML and you're good to go.
