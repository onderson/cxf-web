Project Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can already modify XML at runtime; we could do with visualizations
using Scala, Ruby, Groovy, Python so that folks can view & edit the
routes in whatever language they want and hack them. For more see the
link:web-console.html[Web Console] which supports updating the routes at
runtime using the XML structure.

To do this we'll need to be able to turn a RouteDefinition back into the
DSLs - such as Groovy/Ruby/Scala/Python

[[GSoC2009-WeekofMay11-May17,2009]]
Week of May 11 - May 17, 2009
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Try most of the test cases of camel-core

[[GSoC2009-WeeksofMay23-June7,2009]]
Weeks of May 23 - June 7, 2009
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Learn the camel-web component and the RESTful WS tool:
Jersey................finished
* Do a rough prototype which supports Groovy
expression.............................finished
** A prototype is implemented and support creating routes by using
Groovy language. We can use the face as follows to create a route on
Camel.
** http://docs.google.com/View?id=df6drqqg_1391f4s9wmhf
** Now the Camel-web module depends on Camel-groovy module.
* Submit the late design document, expected
previously................................finished

[[GSoC2009-WeekofJune8-June14,2009]]
Week of June 8 - June 14, 2009
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Improve Groovy Route Editor
* Do Ruby route editing
support.......................................................finished
** The editor form now support creating routes by using Ruby language.
We can use the face as follows to create a route on Camel.
** http://docs.google.com/View?id=df6drqqg_1393gczgfzgp
** Now the Camel-web module depends on Camel-ruby module.
* Do some modification on Xml Route editor if
needed...................................canceled
* Do the Groovy style view of route.(Now the editor can only support
creating operation, but has no idea how to display a route in
GroovyRouteBuilder style).........canceled
* Commit a camel-web-20090611 patch, which contains the Groovy and Ruby
route editing support......finished

[[GSoC2009-WeekofJune22-June27,2009]]
Week of June 22 - June 27, 2009
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* http://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-1392. It's a little
complex to translate the RouteDefinition into GroovyRouteBuilder, so in
this week I still work at it.
* http://docs.google.com/View?id=df6drqqg_1396cnhrwzmf
* http://docs.google.com/View?id=df6drqqg_1398w9jt74hf
* Now the groovyRenderer can support most of the EIP route definitions.
It can generate a overview of the route definition, but can't support
Expression. Current XML editor also has this problem, it just replace
the expression definition with a <expressionDefinition/> element.

* I want to solve it through digging into the ExpressionNode and
ExpressionDefinition level, but after a lot of work and test, I found it
so difficult because in ExpressionDefinnition, some Groovy closures are
embedded in and hard to restore to the original states. I will post some
of my experiments on mailing list for discusses.

[[GSoC2009-WeekofJune28-July6,2009]]
Week of June 28 - July 6, 2009
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Improve the groovyRenderer.
* Do plenty of test (test cases of org.apache.camel.processor in
camel-core).
* http://docs.google.com/View?id=df6drqqg_1400hgqpt3cg test records:
lines not with a prefixion "#" have been supported.

[[GSoC2009-WeekofJuly7-July13,2009]]
Week of July 7 - July 13, 2009

* https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-1804. A user guide for
groovy renderer to show how to use, what DSL features are supported, and
any know holes.

[[GSoC2009-WeekofJuly14-July19,2009]]
Week of July 14 - July 19, 2009
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Write the user guide of groovy renderer.
* Improve the code of groovy renderer, to reduce some hard code in it,
especially for the Expression Definition processing.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Add several samples to show off the functionalities of groovy renderer
** link:content-based-routing-on-camel.html[Content Based Routing on
Camel] shows how to define you processor and invoke it through
link:web-console.html[Web Console]. It also shows how to define
link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router] on
link:web-console.html[Web Console].
** link:load-balance-for-existing-messaging-service.html[Load Balance
for Existing Messaging Service] gives a sample at first and adds
link:load-balancer.html[Load Balancer] for it.
* Clean up the related document for final evaluation
** Add several screen shots for
link:groovy-renderer-user-guide.html[Groovy Renderer User Guide] to
present how to edit a route on link:web-console.html[Web Console].
* Submit all the deliverables before Aug 19
