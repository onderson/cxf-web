Advanced configuration of CamelContext using Spring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using Spring the CamelContext can be pre configured based on
defined beans in spring XML. +
This wiki page documentes these features. Most of these features
requires *Camel 2.0*.

[[AdvancedconfigurationofCamelContextusingSpring-Whatcanbeconfigured]]
What can be configured
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following functions can be configured:

* Class resolvers
* Lifecycle factories
* Registry for lookup
* link:debugger.html[Debugger], link:tracer.html[Tracer],
link:delay-interceptor.html[Delay] and
link:uuidgenerator.html[UuidGenerator]
* link:intercept.html[Intercept]
* link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful Shutdown]
* link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching]
* Logging

Camel will configure these functions by doing a lookup in the Spring
bean registry to find beans of the given type +
When Camel finds and uses any of these it logs at `INFO` level.

The following list all requires at most 1 beans defined. If there are
more than 1 bean of this type, then Camel will *not* use it.

for naming MBeans for link:camel-jmx.html[management].

|NodeIdFactory |0..1 |*Camel 2.10:* To use a 3rd part node id factory.

|EventFactory |0..1 |*Camel 2.1:* To use a 3rd part event factory.

|EventNotifier |0..1 |*Camel 2.1:* To use a 3rd part event notifier. In
Camel 2.2 onwards you can have multiple notifiers, see next table.

executor service strategy. More details at
link:threading-model.html[Threading Model].

factory. More details at link:threading-model.html[Threading Model].

|ProcessorFactory |0..1 |*Camel 2.4:* To use a 3rd part processor
factory.

link:uuidgenerator.html[UuidGenerator].

|StreamCachingStrategy |0..1 |*Camel 2.12:* To use a 3rd part
link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] strategy.

|UnitOfWorkFactory |0..1 |*Camel 2.12.3/2.13:* To use 3rd part
`UnitOfWork` implementations created by the factory.

|RuntimeEndpointRegistry |0..1 |*Camel 2.13.1:* To use a 3rd party
RuntimeEndpointRegistry implementation.

|Logger |0..1 |*Camel 2.12.4/2.13.1:* To use provided org.slf4j.Logger
for link:log.html[Log] component and link:logeip.html[log() EIP].

|AsyncProcessorAwaitManager |0..1 |*Camel 2.15:* To use a 3rd part async
process await manager.

|ModelJAXBContextFactory |0..1 |*Camel 2.15.2:* To use a 3rd party model
JAXB ContextFactory

|MessageHistoryFactory |0..1 |*Camel 2.17:* To use a 3rd party
MessageHistoryFactory implementation.
|=======================================================================

And the following options have support for any number of beans defined.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type |Number of beans |Description
|InterceptStrategy |0..n |To use your own link:intercept.html[Intercept]
that intercepts every processing steps in all routes in the
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext]. For instance you can use this to
do an AOP like performance timer interceptor.

|LifecycleStrategy |0..n |*Camel 2.1:* To use 3rd party lifecycle
strategies. By default Camel uses a JMX aware that does JMX
instrumentation.

|EventNotifier |0..n |*Camel 2.2:* To use 3rd part event notifiers.

|RoutePolicyFactory |0..n |*Camel 2.14:* To use a 3rd party route policy
factory to create a route policy for every route.
|=======================================================================

Camel will log at `INFO` level if it pickup and uses a custom bean using
`org.apache.camel.spring.CamelContextFactoryBean` as name.

Using container wide interceptors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Imagine that you have multiple link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] and
you want to configure that they all use the same container wide
interceptor. How do we do that? Well we can leverage the fact that Camel
can auto detect and use custom interceptors. So what we simply do is to
define our interceptor in the spring xml file. The sample below does
this and also define 2 camel contexts. The sample is based on unit test.

*Spring DSL*

Okay lets build our interceptor to simply count the number of
interceptions. This is quite easy as we can just implement this logic in
our implementation directly as the code below illustrates:

*InterceptorStrategy*

When Camel boots up it logs at `INFO` level the container wide
interceptors it have found:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
INFO  CamelContextFactoryBean        - Using custom intercept strategy with id: myInterceptor and implementation:org.apache.camel.spring.interceptor.ContainerWideInterceptor@b84c44
----

*Notice:* If we have more than 1 container wide interceptor, we can just
define them as spring bean. Camel will find and use them.
