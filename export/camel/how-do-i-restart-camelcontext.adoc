How do I restart CamelContext
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] provides operations to control
its lifecycle, see more at link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext].

*Note:* Obviously you can also restart a Camel application if its been
deployed in a server. For example a WAR application can be restarted
using the usual means for managing web applications.
