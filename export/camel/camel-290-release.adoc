[[Camel2.9.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.9.0 release which approx 497 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Introduced `ThreadPoolFactory` with a simpler API for 3rd party SPI.
See link:threading-model.html[Threading Model] for more details.
* The `ScheduledExecutorService` created by Camel is guarded with a
queue size check, to guard against OOME due the JDK thread pool is
unbounded task queue.
* The link:soap.html[SOAP] data format now supports using multiple
parameters on the JAXB objects.
* The link:bean.html[Bean] component now supports specifying parameter
values to use directly in the method syntax. See more details at
link:bean-binding.html[Bean Binding]. For example to invoke a bean with
body as first parameter, and a boolean true as second you can now do:
`.to("bean:myBean?method=myMethod(body, true)")`
* The link:bean.html[Bean] component supports binding to private class
beans by fallback to use interface methods.
* Improved labels of all model definitions which appear in
link:tracer.html[Tracer] output
* Reduced dependency for `camel-core` to not require
`commons-management` JAR anymore
* Added blueprint support of cxfrs endpoint.
* Camel no longer depend on using Spring JARs for having Camel enlisted
in link:camel-jmx.html[JMX].
* Introduced a set of Camel JMX annotations in
`org.apache.camel.api.management` that can be used to easily instrument
Camel link:components.html[Components], link:eip.html[EIP]s, custom
link:processor.html[Processor]s, link:bean.html[Bean]s etc. for being
managed in link:camel-jmx.html[JMX]. Using the Spring JMX annotations is
still supported (you would need `camel-spring` on the classpath).
* Updated the link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator2] to allow for manually
completing all exchange groups by sending a message containing the
header `Exchange.AGGREGATION_COMPLETE_ALL_GROUPS` set to true.
* Updated the link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator2] to support
forceCompletionOnStop option to complete all current aggregated
exchanges when the context is stopped.
* Removed dependency on Spring JARs in the following components:
link:validation.html[Validation], link:xslt.html[XSLT],
link:velocity.html[Velocity], link:freemarker.html[FreeMarker],
link:flatpack.html[Flatpack], link:stringtemplate.html[StringTemplate],
link:ibatis.html[iBATIS], link:jing.html[Jing], link:msv.html[MSV],
link:xquery.html[XQuery], link:test.html[Test],
link:groovy.html[Groovy], link:scripting-languages.html[Scripting
Languages], link:mail.html[Mail] and link:quickfix.html[Quickfix].
* Using link:content-enricher.html[pollEnrich] with a file/ftp endpoint
will now only poll on demand, beforehand the polling could be started
when the route started.
* Added option `ReplyToType` on link:jms.html[JMS] to allow people to
control which kind of reply queue they are using (temporary, shared,
exclusive). Added support for exclusive reply queues. Mind they have
some limitations, by which the shared dont have. So use exclusive with a
bit caution.
* Added `wereSentTo` to link:notifybuilder.html[NotifyBuilder] allowing
to set expectation that link:exchange.html[Exchange]s was sent to the
given endpoint uri.
* link:bindy.html[Bindy] in CSV format now uses trim, clip, and length
attributes on @DataField when marshalling.
* Improved managed browsable endpoints (JMX) so you can browse all/range
messages and whether to include message body or not.
* link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] endpoints is now
browsable endpoints. For example using JMX people can browse the
endpoint listing available files. The returned data does *not* contain
the actual file body to avoid loading big data into memory.
* Added `replaceFromWith` to link:advicewith.html[AdviceWith] making it
easy to swap a route input endpoint with something else, for easier unit
testing.
* Added Java DSL support for route autoStartup(String) and
autoStartup(boolean)
* Switched to a better performing non locking endpoint cache based on
Google's ConcurrentLinkedHashMap.
* Added `isUseAdviceWith` to link:camel-test.html[Camel Test] which
allows end users to tell Camel that the unit tests uses
link:advicewith.html[AdviceWith] which allows you to defer starting
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] until after the adviceWith has been
executed.
* Added `filtersRef` option to link:jetty.html[Jetty] endpoint, and it
supports to setup the Filters on the Jetty endpoints.
* Added `ciphers` option to the link:ftp2.html[SFTP] endpoint to allow
configuration of the ciphers used by default.
* Added `fastExitsCheck` option to the link:ftp2.html[SFTP FTP] endpoint
to check the file exits fast.
* Added `errorHandler` option to the link:jms.html[JMS] component which
allows you to set a `org.springframework.util.ErrorHandler` to be
invoked in case of any uncaught exceptions thrown while processing a
`Message`.
* Added `idleConsumerLimit` option to the link:jms.html[JMS] component
which sets the limit for the number of consumers that are allowed to be
idle at any given time.
* link:simple.html[Simple] language has a much better syntax parser,
being able to report what and where syntax errors are. Added unary
operators, which for example can be used to increment counters.
* link:simple.html[Simple] language now supports nested functions, so
you can do "$\{header.$\{header.bar}}", for example to refer to a header
key from another header.
* link:simple.html[Simple] language can now configure custom start/end
tokens for its built-in functions.
* The link:jpa.html[JPA] component has been upgraded from using the JPA1
spec to use JPA2 spec.
* The link:csv.html[CSV] component now always returns a List<List>
regardless if 1 or more rows returned, to be consistent.
* link:resequencer.html[Resequencer] now pre validates incoming
link:exchange.html[Exchange] and throws `CamelExchangeException` if
invalid. Added new option `ignoreInvalidExchanges` to suppress the
exception and ignore invalid exchanges.
* Improved existing and added more link:karaf.html[Karaf] Camel
commands.
* Improved link:bean.html[Bean] component and method call expressions to
be able to invoke static methods, without creating a new instance of the
class.
* link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] now exposes average load statics on
CamelContext and Route mbeans. Its similar to unix load stats per 1, 5
and 15 minutes.
* Added support for `minDepth` and `maxDepth` option on the
link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumers.
* Improved the link:aws-s3.html[AWS-S3] component to support more
headers in the producer.
* link:cometd.html[Cometd] now includes headers in the server message.
* link:ftp2.html[SFTP] now supports interactive keyboard authentication,
but entering the password in the prompt.
* ManagedTracer now supports detailed JMX TraceEvent Notifications. This
allows to watch message flows using JConsole and provides an ideal base
for external tooling
* Exchange.HTTP_URI query part will take effect on the producer of
link:http.html[HTTP] and link:http4.html[HTTP4].
* Add `camelContextId` to link:mdc-logging.html[MDC logging].
* Hadoop consumer supports auto merging multiple segment files.
* link:jms.html[JMS] consumer has new option `asyncConsumer` which
allows to enable link:asynchronous-routing-engine.html[Asynchronous
Routing Engine]
* The link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[camel-archetype-component] allows
to specify the component name.
* link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer]s such as
link:file2.html[File] or link:ftp2.html[FTP] supports new option
`sendEmptyMessageWhenIdle` to send an empty message if there was no
messages to poll.
* Added option `allowStAX` on link:xslt.html[XSLT] and
link:xquery.html[XQuery] to control whether StAX (Streaming API for XML)
is preferred as the `javax.xml.transform.Source`.
* Added `properties` function to link:scripting-languages.html[Scripting
Languages] to make it easier to leverage Camel
link:properties.html[Properties] component from scripts.
* Added `timeoutCheckerExecutorService` and
`timeoutCheckerExecutorServiceRef` options to the aggregator. If using
either of the `completionTimeout`, `completionTimeoutExpression`, or
`completionInterval` options a background thread is created to check for
the completion for every aggregator. This doesn't scale well when you
have many routes with an aggregator (a thread is created for every
aggregator). Setting these options allow you to control the number of
threads by providing a custom thread pool.
* link:splitter.html[Splitting] big files such as XML files can now be
done in a streamed low-memory footprint mode using the
link:tokenizer.html[Tokenizer] language or the link:stax.html[StAX]
component.
* The link:language.html[Language] component can now load scripts from
classpath or file system. As well having a cached option.
* Further improved masking of passwords in URIs specified in the user
info part, in the Camel logs.
* Optimized link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] over
link:jms.html[JMS] when using named replyTo queues to cache consumer if
possible, making it go faster. This applies when using either the
`replytToType=Exclusive` or `replyToDestinationSelectorName` options.
* Fixed link:jpa.html[JPA] consumer to ensure to rollback if processing
an link:exchange.html[Exchange] failed.
* Added `quote` option to `@CsvRecord` in link:bindy.html[Bindy] to make
it easy to specify using a quote character when marshalling from Object
to CSV format.
* Added `consumer.transacted` option to link:jpa.html[JPA] to control
whether the consumer should regard the batch as a single encompassing
transaction or not.
* Added ability in link:xslt.html[XSLT] component to dynamically
override stylesheet used via `CamelXsltResourceUri` message header.
* Added ability in link:aws-sns.html[AWS-SNS] component to specify the
topic policy.
* Added ability in link:aws-s3.html[AWS-S3] component to specify the
bucket policy and the storage class.
* link:log.html[Log] component and link:logeip.html[LogEIP] now supports
the http://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/Marker.html[Marker] option
* link:log.html[Log] and link:tracer.html[Tracer] now have a default
`maxChars` option at `10000` to avoid logging very big data.
* Added ability in link:sql-component.html[SQL] to execute SQL batch
statements.
* Added the configuration support of queueSize and concurrentConsumers
options on the link:seda.html[SEDA] link:vm.html[VM] component.
* Added MBean interfaces in `org.apache.camel.api.management.mbean`
which clients can use to access Camel MBeans.* Added MBean interfaces in
`org.apache.camel.api.management.mbean` which clients can use to access
Camel MBeans.
* Introduced `AbstractJdbcMessageIdRepository` in
link:sql-component.html[SQL Component] to make it easier to create
custom JDBC based link:idempotent-consumer.html[Idempotent Consumer]

which could cause the link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] to fail
with an assertion error at first redelivery attempt.
* Fixed issue with using `doneFile` option on link:ftp2.html[FTP] when
from a Windows computer connecting to a Unix FTP server, due to wrong
path separator in use.
* Fixed issue with link:bindy.html[Bindy] in CSV mode when marshalling
not using correct separator char if given an escaped separator char on

[[Camel2.9.0Release-APIbreaking]]
API breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We did some fairly large refactoring in preparation for camel 3.0. In
Camel 2.9.0 most changes should be compatible. If you hit any
problematic API changes please report in jira and we will try to add
compatibility stubs in a 2.9.x release. +
The main goal of this refactoring is to prepare for a self contained
minimal API that can be used as a basis for component development. +
We already did some changes in regard to this in 2.9.0 to make
backporting 3.0 features easier once we start with camel 3.0.

* The class `ExecutorServiceStrategy` is deprecated in favor of a new
`ExecutorServiceManager` class, which have a slightly reduced and
improved API. See link:threading-model.html[Threading Model] for more
details.
* The `org.apache.camel.component.ResourceBasedComponent` class from
`camel-spring` has been deprecated. Use `DefaultComponent` instead.
* The `org.apache.camel.component.ResourceBasedEndpoint` class from
`camel-spring` has been deprecated in favor of a new
`org.apache.camel.component.ResourceEndpoint` in `camel-core`, and its
dependency on Spring JARs has been removed. Use the new APIs on
`ResourceEndpoint` to load resources.
* Changed the method `beforePoll` slightly in the
`org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy` class.
* `ServiceSupport` and `EventNotifierSupport` classes are moved to
org.apache.camel.support. This package is meant for mostly abstract base
classes that make it easier to implement the API. To keep compatibility
the old classes are kept as @Deprecated versions (see
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-4358[CAMEL-4358])
* `ServiceSupport` now does no handle child services anymore (was used
only in two places in `camel-core`). A new class `ChildServiceSupport`
now handles this case. Additionally the
`org.apache.camel.StatefulService` interface was created which allows to
access `ServiceSupport` methods without knowing the implementation.
* `DataFormatResolver` does not support `resolveDataFormatDefinition`
anymore. The current implementations for OSGi and Default where exactly
the same so this code was moved to `DefaultCamelContext`. If this is
needed please open a jira issue
* All methods in CamelContext that reference model elements where
deprecated. An additional interface
`org.apache.camel.model.ModelCamelContext` was created to hold these
methods
* `Ordered` interface was moved from `org.apache.camel.util` to
`org.apache.camel`
* `BytesSource` and `StringSource` were moved from
`org.apache.camel.converter.jaxp` to `org.apache.camel` as they are used
in several places
* `TimeoutMap` interface was moved from `org.apache.camel.util` to
`org.apache.camel`
* `DefaultTimeoutMap` was moved from `org.apache.camel.util` to
`org.apache.camel.support` as it needs access to `ServiceSupport`
* Moved some management interfaces from `org.apache.camel.management` to
`org.apache.camel.spi.management`
* Moved `DefaultChannel` from `org.apache.camel.processor` to
`org.apache.camel.processor.interceptor`
* `FileUtil.removeFile` added new option, and will throw `IOException`
in case of exception occurred
* The `CamelTestSupport`'s context, template, consumer fields is no
longer static (reason for changing is to foster faster unit testing)
* Added `onRemove`, `onStart`, `onStop`, `onSuspend`, and `onResume`
methods to `org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicy`
* Removed Spring related methods from `ScriptBuilder` in `camel-script`
* Added `RouteContext` as parameter to `configure` method on
`ErrorHandlerBuilder`
* The link:mail.html[Mail] component no longer uses Spring API, which
means any custom `JavaMailSender` should now implement
`org.apache.camel.component.mail.JavaMailSender` instead.
* The link:quickfix.html[Quickfix] component no longer uses Spring API,
which mean if you use XML DSL to setup QuickFix settings, then you need
to adjust accordingly. See details link:quickfix.html[Quickfix].

[[Camel2.9.0Release-Internal/NonAPIrefactoringsthatmayaffectusers]]
Internal/Non API refactorings that may affect users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `org.apache.camel.WrappedFile` interface was introduced as abstraction
of `GenericFile` for usage outside the file component
* `ModelHelper` was moved from `org.apache.camel.util` to
`org.apache.camel.model` to avoid references from util to model
* The link:karaf.html[Karaf] commands have been renamed

[[Camel2.9.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The link:tracer.html[Tracer] may not output all details for some
situations such as when using `onCompletion` or `intercept` etc.
* The project cannot fully build the site using Maven (eg running
`"mvn site"`. There is no plan to make this work as the project do not
use the maven site.
* The source code cannot fully build with JDK 7

[[Camel2.9.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The link:xslt.html[XSLT], and link:validation.html[Validation]
components has been moved from `camel-spring` to `camel-core` as they no
longer depend upon Spring JARs
* Building the source with Apache Maven 2.x is *deprecated* and support
for that is to be removed in the next release.
* link:debugger.html[Debugger] is now disabled by default in
link:camel-test.html[Camel Test]. You would need to override
`isUseDebugger()` method and return `true` to enable it.
* link:simple.html[Simple] language improved syntax parser.
link:simple.html[Simple] is now more strict and will report syntax
errors for invalid input. For example link:predicate.html[Predicate]s
now requires literal texts to be enclosed in quotes, just as any
programming language such as Java would do. Range operator also requires
the range to be enclosed in quotes as well. See more details at
link:simple.html[Simple].
* The link:jpa.html[JPA] component has been upgraded from using the JPA1
spec to use JPA2 spec.
* The link:csv.html[CSV] component now always returns a `List<List>`
regardless if 1 or more rows returned, to be consistent.

[[Camel2.9.0Release-Notice]]
Notice
~~~~~~

* Removed ANT support for the link:examples.html[Examples]
* The `commons-management` JAR is no longer required as dependency.
* Camel no longer depend on using Spring JARs for having Camel enlisted
in link:camel-jmx.html[JMX].
* Building the source with Apache Maven 2.x is *deprecated* and support
for that is to be removed in the next release.
* If you want to deploy Apache Camel 2.9.0 into Apache Karaf, we highly
recommend to use the 'jre.properties.cxf' configuration, which is part
of Apache Karaf 2.2.5.
