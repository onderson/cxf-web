Memory leak when adding and removing routes at runtime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you add and remove many routes at runtime, then take notice that
link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] may take up memory when routes is added. +
As Camel cannot 100% reclaim all mbeans when removing a route (some
resources may be shared by other routes, etc).

Therefore its advised to disable JMX for new routes, by setting
`registerNewRoutes=false`. See details at link:camel-jmx.html[JMX].
