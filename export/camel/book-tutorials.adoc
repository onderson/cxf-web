There now follows the documentation on camel tutorials

We have a number of tutorials as listed below. The tutorials often comes
with source code which is either available in the Camel
link:download.html[Download] or attached to the wiki page.

**Notice**

These tutorials listed below, is hosted at Apache. We offer the
link:articles.html[Articles] page where we have a link collection for
3rd party Camel material, such as tutorials, blog posts, published
articles, videos, pod casts, presentations, and so forth.

If you have written a Camel related article, then we are happy to
provide a link to it. You can contact the Camel link:team.html[Team],
for example using the link:mailing-lists.html[Mailing Lists], (or post a
tweet with the word Apache Camel).

This tutorial was kindly donated to Apache Camel by Martin Gilday.

[[BookTutorials-Preface]]
Preface
~~~~~~~

This tutorial aims to guide the reader through the stages of creating a
project which uses Camel to facilitate the routing of messages from a
JMS queue to a http://www.springramework.org[Spring] service. The route
works in a synchronous fashion returning a response to the client.

[[BookTutorials-Prerequisites]]
Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses Maven to setup the Camel project and for dependencies
for artifacts.

[[BookTutorials-Distribution]]
Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This sample is distributed with the Camel distribution as
`examples/camel-example-spring-jms`.

[[BookTutorials-About]]
About
~~~~~

This tutorial is a simple example that demonstrates more the fact how
well Camel is seamless integrated with Spring to leverage the best of
both worlds. This sample is client server solution using JMS messaging
as the transport. The sample has two flavors of servers and also for
clients demonstrating different techniques for easy communication.

The Server is a JMS message broker that routes incoming messages to a
business service that does computations on the received message and
returns a response. +
The EIP patterns used in this sample are:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Pattern |Description
|link:message-channel.html[Message Channel] |We need a channel so the
Clients can communicate with the server.

|link:message.html[Message] |The information is exchanged using the
Camel Message interface.

|link:message-translator.html[Message Translator] |This is where Camel
shines as the message exchange between the Server and the Clients are
text based strings with numbers. However our business service uses int
for numbers. So Camel can do the message translation automatically.

|link:message-endpoint.html[Message Endpoint] |It should be easy to send
messages to the Server from the the clients. This is achieved with
Camel's powerful Endpoint pattern that even can be more powerful
combined with Spring remoting. The tutorial has clients using each kind
of technique for this.

|link:point-to-point-channel.html[Point to Point Channel] |The client
and server exchange data using point to point using a JMS queue.

|link:event-driven-consumer.html[Event Driven Consumer] |The JMS broker
is event driven and is invoked when the client sends a message to the
server.
|=======================================================================

We use the following Camel components:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Component |Description
|link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ] |We use Apache ActiveMQ as the JMS broker
on the Server side

|link:bean.html[Bean] |We use the bean binding to easily route the
messages to our business service. This is a very powerful component in
Camel.

|link:file2.html[File] |In the AOP enabled Server we store audit trails
as files.

|link:jms.html[JMS] |Used for the JMS messaging
|=======================================================================

[[BookTutorials-CreatetheCamelProject]]
Create the Camel Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the purposes of the tutorial a single Maven project will be used for
both the client and server. Ideally you would break your application
down into the appropriate components.

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=org.example
-DartifactId=CamelWithJmsAndSpring

[[BookTutorials-UpdatethePOMwithDependencies]]
Update the POM with Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First we need to have dependencies for the core Camel jars, spring, jms
components, and finally ActiveMQ as the message
broker.\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/pom.xml}As
we use spring xml configuration for the ActiveMQ JMS broker we need this
dependency:\{snippet:id=e2|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/pom.xml}

[[BookTutorials-WritingtheServer]]
Writing the Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[BookTutorials-CreatetheSpringService]]
Create the Spring Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this example the Spring service (our business service) on the server
will be a simple multiplier which trebles in the received
value.\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/server/Multiplier.java}And
the implementation of this service
is:\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/server/Treble.java}Notice
that this class has been annotated with the @Service spring annotation.
This ensures that this class is registered as a bean in the registry
with the given name *multiplier*.

[[BookTutorials-DefinetheCamelRoutes]]
Define the Camel Routes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/server/ServerRoutes.java}This
defines a Camel route _from_ the JMS queue named *numbers* _to_ the
Spring link:bean.html[bean] named *multiplier*. Camel will create a
consumer to the JMS queue which forwards all received messages onto the
the Spring bean, using the method named *multiply*.

[[BookTutorials-ConfigureSpring]]
Configure Spring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Spring config file is placed under `META-INF/spring` as this is the
default location used by the link:camel-maven-plugin.html[Camel Maven
Plugin], which we will later use to run our server. +
First we need to do the standard scheme declarations in the top. In the
camel-server.xml we are using spring beans as the default *bean:*
namespace and springs *context:*. For configuring ActiveMQ we use
*broker:* and for Camel we of course have *camel:*. Notice that we don't
use version numbers for the camel-spring schema. At runtime the schema
is resolved in the Camel bundle. If we use a specific version number
such as 1.4 then its IDE friendly as it would be able to import it and
provide smart completion etc. See link:xml-reference.html[Xml Reference]
for further
details.\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/camel-server.xml}We
use Spring annotations for doing IoC dependencies and its component-scan
features comes to the rescue as it scans for spring annotations in the
given package
name:\{snippet:id=e2|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/camel-server.xml}Camel
will of course not be less than Spring in this regard so it supports a
similar feature for scanning of Routes. This is configured as shown
below. +
Notice that we also have enabled the link:camel-jmx.html[JMXAgent] so we
will be able to introspect the Camel Server with a JMX
Console.\{snippet:id=e3|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/camel-server.xml}The
ActiveMQ JMS broker is also configured in this xml file. We set it up to
listen on TCP port
61610.\{snippet:id=e4|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/camel-server.xml}As
this examples uses JMS then Camel needs a link:jms.html[JMS component]
that is connected with the ActiveMQ broker. This is configured as shown
below:\{snippet:id=e5|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/camel-server.xml}*Notice:*
The link:jms.html[JMS component] is configured in standard Spring beans,
but the gem is that the bean id can be referenced from Camel routes -
meaning we can do routing using the JMS Component by just using *jms:*
prefix in the route URI. What happens is that Camel will find in the
Spring Registry for a bean with the id="jms". Since the bean id can have
arbitrary name you could have named it id="jmsbroker" and then
referenced to it in the routing as
`from="jmsbroker:queue:numbers).to("multiplier");` +
We use the vm protocol to connect to the ActiveMQ server as its embedded
in this application.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|component-scan |Defines the package to be scanned for Spring stereotype
annotations, in this case, to load the "multiplier" bean

|camel-context |Defines the package to be scanned for Camel routes. Will
find the `ServerRoutes` class and create the routes contained within it

|jms bean |Creates the Camel JMS component
|=======================================================================

[[BookTutorials-RuntheServer]]
Run the Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Server is started using the `org.apache.camel.spring.Main` class
that can start camel-spring application out-of-the-box. The Server can
be started in several flavors:

* as a standard java main application - just start the
`org.apache.camel.spring.Main` class
* using maven jave:exec
* using link:camel-run-maven-goal.html[camel:run]

In this sample as there are two servers (with and without AOP) we have
prepared some profiles in maven to start the Server of your choice. +
The server is started with: +
`mvn compile exec:java -PCamelServer`

[[BookTutorials-WritingTheClients]]
Writing The Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This sample has three clients demonstrating different Camel techniques
for communication

* CamelClient using the link:producertemplate.html[ProducerTemplate] for
Spring template style coding
* CamelRemoting using Spring Remoting
* CamelEndpoint using the Message Endpoint EIP pattern using a neutral
Camel API

[[BookTutorials-ClientUsingTheProducerTemplate]]
Client Using The ProducerTemplate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will initially create a client by directly using `ProducerTemplate`.
We will later create a client which uses Spring remoting to hide the
fact that messaging is being
used.\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/resources/camel-client.xml}\{snippet:id=e2|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/resources/camel-client.xml}\{snippet:id=e3|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/resources/camel-client.xml}The
client will not use the link:camel-maven-plugin.html[Camel Maven Plugin]
so the Spring XML has been placed in _src/main/resources_ to not
conflict with the server configs.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|=======================================================================
|camelContext |The Camel context is defined but does not contain any
routes

|template |The `ProducerTemplate` is used to place messages onto the JMS
queue

|jms bean |This initialises the Camel JMS component, allowing us to
place messages onto the queue
|=======================================================================

And the CamelClient source
code:\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/client/CamelClient.java}The
`ProducerTemplate` is retrieved from a Spring `ApplicationContext` and
used to manually place a message on the "numbers" JMS queue. The
`requestBody` method will use the exchange pattern InOut, which states
that the call should be synchronous, and that the caller expects a
response.

Before running the client be sure that both the ActiveMQ broker and the
`CamelServer` are running.

[[BookTutorials-ClientUsingSpringRemoting]]
Client Using Spring Remoting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

link:spring-remoting.html[Spring Remoting] "eases the development of
remote-enabled services". It does this by allowing you to invoke remote
services through your regular Java interface, masking that a remote
service is being
called.\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/resources/camel-client-remoting.xml}The
snippet above only illustrates the different and how Camel easily can
setup and use Spring Remoting in one line configurations.

The *proxy* will create a proxy service bean for you to use to make the
remote invocations. The *serviceInterface* property details which Java
interface is to be implemented by the proxy. TheÂ *serviceUrl* defines
where messages sent to this proxy bean will be directed. Here we define
the JMS endpoint with the "numbers" queue we used when working with
Camel template directly. The value of the *id* property is the name that
will be the given to the bean when it is exposed through the Spring
`ApplicationContext`. We will use this name to retrieve the service in
our client. I have named the bean _multiplierProxy_ simply to highlight
that it is not the same multiplier bean as is being used by
`CamelServer`. They are in completely independent contexts and have no
knowledge of each other. As you are trying to mask the fact that
remoting is being used in a real application you would generally not
include proxy in the name.

And the Java client source
code:\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/client/CamelClientRemoting.java}Again,
the client is similar to the original client, but with some important
differences.

1.  The Spring context is created with the new
_camel-client-remoting.xml_
2.  We retrieve the proxy bean instead of a `ProducerTemplate`. In a
non-trivial example you would have the bean injected as in the standard
Spring manner.
3.  The multiply method is then called directly. In the client we are
now working to an interface. There is no mention of Camel or JMS inside
our Java code.

[[BookTutorials-ClientUsingMessageEndpointEIPPattern]]
Client Using Message Endpoint EIP Pattern
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This client uses the Message Endpoint EIP pattern to hide the complexity
to communicate to the Server. The Client uses the same simple API to get
hold of the endpoint, create an exchange that holds the message, set the
payload and create a producer that does the send and receive. All done
using the same neutral Camel API for *all* the components in Camel. So
if the communication was socket TCP based you just get hold of a
different endpoint and all the java code stays the same. That is really
powerful.

Okay enough talk, show me the
code!\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-spring-jms/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/client/CamelClientEndpoint.java}Switching
to a different component is just a matter of using the correct endpoint.
So if we had defined a TCP endpoint as: `"mina:tcp://localhost:61610"`
then its just a matter of getting hold of this endpoint instead of the
JMS and all the rest of the java code is exactly the same.

[[BookTutorials-RuntheClients]]
Run the Clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Clients is started using their main class respectively.

* as a standard java main application - just start their main class
* using maven jave:exec

In this sample we start the clients using maven: +
`mvn compile exec:java -PCamelClient` +
`mvn compile exec:java -PCamelClientRemoting` +
`mvn compile exec:java -PCamelClientEndpoint`

Also see the Maven `pom.xml` file how the profiles for the clients is
defined.

[[BookTutorials-UsingtheCamelMavenPlugin]]
Using the Camel Maven Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The link:camel-maven-plugin.html[Camel Maven Plugin] allows you to run
your Camel routes directly from Maven. This negates the need to create a
host application, as we did with Camel server, simply to start up the
container. This can be very useful during development to get Camel
routes running quickly.

pom.xml<build> <plugins> <plugin> <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
<artifactId>camel-maven-plugin</artifactId> </plugin> </plugins>
</build>

All that is required is a new plugin definition in your Maven POM. As we
have already placed our Camel config in the default location
(camel-server.xml has been placed in META-INF/spring/) we do not need to
tell the plugin where the route definitions are located. Simply run
`mvn camel:run`.

[[BookTutorials-UsingCamelJMX]]
Using Camel JMX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Camel has extensive support for JMX and allows us to inspect the Camel
Server at runtime. As we have enabled the JMXAgent in our tutorial we
can fire up the jconsole and connect to the following service URI:
`service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi/camel`. Notice that
Camel will log at INFO level the JMX Connector URI:

... DefaultInstrumentationAgent INFO JMX connector thread started on
service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://claus-acer:1099/jmxrmi/camel ...

In the screenshot below we can see the route and its performance
metrics: +

Tutorial - camel-example-reportincident
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[BookTutorials-Introduction]]
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating this tutorial was inspired by a real life use-case I discussed
over the phone with a colleague. He was working at a client whom uses a
heavy-weight integration platform from a very large vendor. He was in
talks with developer shops to implement a new integration on this
platform. His trouble was the shop tripled the price when they realized
the platform of choice. So I was wondering how we could do this
integration with Camel. Can it be done, without tripling the cost
image:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/s/en_GB/5997/6f42626d00e36f53fe51440403446ca61552e2a2.1/_/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png[(wink)].

This tutorial is written during the development of the integration. I
have decided to start off with a sample that isn't Camel's but standard
Java and then plugin Camel as we goes. Just as when people needed to
learn Spring you could consume it piece by piece, the same goes with
Camel.

The target reader is person whom hasn't experience or just started using
Camel.

[[BookTutorials-Motivationforthistutorial]]
Motivation for this tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I wrote this tutorial motivated as Camel lacked an example application
that was based on the web application deployment model. The entire world
hasn't moved to pure OSGi deployments yet.

The full source code for this tutorial as complete is part of the Apache
Camel distribution in the `examples/camel-example-reportincident`
directory

[[BookTutorials-Theuse-case]]
The use-case
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal is to allow staff to report incidents into a central
administration. For that they use client software where they report the
incident and submit it to the central administration. As this is an
integration in a transition phase the administration should get these
incidents by email whereas they are manually added to the database. The
client software should gather the incident and submit the information to
the integration platform that in term will transform the report into an
email and send it to the central administrator for manual processing.

The figure below illustrates this process. The end users reports the
incidents using the client applications. The incident is sent to the
central integration platform as webservice. The integration platform
will process the incident and send an OK acknowledgment back to the
client. Then the integration will transform the message to an email and
send it to the administration mail server. The users in the
administration will receive the emails and take it from there.

[[BookTutorials-Parts]]
Parts
~~~~~

This tutorial is divided into sections and parts:

*Section A: Existing Solution, how to slowly use Camel*

Part 1 - This first part explain how to setup the project and get a
webservice exposed using http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF]. In fact we
don't touch Camel yet.

Part 2 - Now we are ready to introduce Camel piece by piece (without
using Spring or any XML configuration file) and create the full feature
integration. This part will introduce different Camel's concepts and How
we can build our solution using them like :

* CamelContext
* Endpoint, Exchange & Producer
* Components : Log, File

Part 3 - Continued from part 2 where we implement that last part of the
solution with the event driven consumer and how to send the email
through the Mail component.

*Section B: The Camel Solution*

Part 4 - We now turn into the path of Camel where it excels - the
routing. +
Part 5 - Is about how embed Camel with Spring and using
link:cxf.html[CXF] endpoints directly in Camel +
Part 6 - Showing a alternative solution primarily using XML instead of
Java code

**Using Axis 2**

See this blog entry by Sagara demonstrating how to use
http://ws.apache.org/axis2/[Apache Axis 2] instead of
http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] as the web service framework.

[[BookTutorials-Prerequisites.1]]
Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses the following frameworks:

* Maven 3.0.4
* Apache Camel 2.10.0
* Apache CXF 2.6.1
* Spring 3.0.7

*Note:* The sample project can be downloaded, see the
link:tutorial-example-reportincident-part1.html[resources] section.

[[BookTutorials-InitialProjectSetup]]
Initial Project Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We want the integration to be a standard .war application that can be
deployed in any web container such as Tomcat, Jetty or even heavy weight
application servers such as WebLogic or WebSphere. There fore we start
off with the standard Maven webapp project that is created with the
following long archetype command:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=org.apache.camel -DartifactId=camel-example-reportincident -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
----

Notice that the groupId etc. doens't have to be org.apache.camel it can
be com.mycompany.whatever. But I have used these package names as the
example is an official part of the Camel distribution.

Then we have the basic maven folder layout. We start out with the
webservice part where we want to use Apache CXF for the webservice
stuff. So we add this to the pom.xml

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <properties>
        <cxf-version>2.6.1</cxf-version>
    </properties>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
        <artifactId>cxf-rt-core</artifactId>
        <version>${cxf-version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
        <artifactId>cxf-rt-frontend-jaxws</artifactId>
        <version>${cxf-version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
        <artifactId>cxf-rt-transports-http</artifactId>
        <version>${cxf-version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

[[BookTutorials-DevelopingtheWebService]]
Developing the WebService
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we want to develop webservice with the contract first approach we
create our .wsdl file. As this is a example we have simplified the model
of the incident to only include 8 fields. In real life the model would
be a bit more complex, but not to much.

We put the wsdl file in the folder `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl` and
name the file `report_incident.wsdl`.

[[BookTutorials-CXFwsdl2java]]
CXF wsdl2java
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Then we integration the CXF wsdl2java generator in the pom.xml so we
have CXF generate the needed POJO classes for our webservice contract. +
However at first we must configure maven to live in the modern world of
Java 1.6 so we must add this to the pom.xml

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
            <!-- to compile with 1.6 -->
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <configuration>
                    <source>1.6</source>
                    <target>1.6</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
----

And then we can add the CXF wsdl2java code generator that will hook into
the compile goal so its automatic run all the time:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
            <!-- CXF wsdl2java generator, will plugin to the compile goal -->
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
                <artifactId>cxf-codegen-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${cxf-version}</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>

                        <phase>generate-sources</phase>
                        <configuration>
                            <sourceRoot>${basedir}/target/generated/src/main/java</sourceRoot>
                            <wsdlOptions>
                                <wsdlOption>
                                    <wsdl>${basedir}/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl/report_incident.wsdl</wsdl>
                                </wsdlOption>
                            </wsdlOptions>
                        </configuration>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>wsdl2java</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
----

You are now setup and should be able to compile the project. So running
the `mvn compile` should run the CXF wsdl2java and generate the source
code in the folder `&{basedir}/target/generated/src/main/java` that we
specified in the pom.xml above. Since its in the
`target/generated/src/main/java` maven will pick it up and include it in
the build process.

[[BookTutorials-Configurationoftheweb.xml]]
Configuration of the web.xml
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next up is to configure the web.xml to be ready to use CXF so we can
expose the webservice. +
As Spring is the center of the universe, or at least is a very important
framework in today's Java land we start with the listener that
kick-starts Spring. This is the usual piece of code:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <!-- the listener that kick-starts Spring -->
    <listener>
        <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
    </listener>
----

And then we have the CXF part where we define the CXF servlet and its
URI mappings to which we have chosen that all our webservices should be
in the path `/webservices/`

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <!-- CXF servlet -->
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>CXFServlet</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>org.apache.cxf.transport.servlet.CXFServlet</servlet-class>
        <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
    </servlet>

    <!-- all our webservices are mapped under this URI pattern -->
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>CXFServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/webservices/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
----

Then the last piece of the puzzle is to configure CXF, this is done in a
spring XML that we link to fron the web.xml by the standard Spring
`contextConfigLocation` property in the web.xml

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <!-- location of spring xml files -->
    <context-param>
        <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
        <param-value>classpath:cxf-config.xml</param-value>
    </context-param>
----

We have named our CXF configuration file `cxf-config.xml` and its
located in the root of the classpath. In Maven land that is we can have
the `cxf-config.xml` file in the `src/main/resources` folder. We could
also have the file located in the WEB-INF folder for instance
`<param-value>/WEB-INF/cxf-config.xml</param-value>`.

[[BookTutorials-Gettingridoftheoldjspworld]]
Getting rid of the old jsp world
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The maven archetype that created the basic folder structure also created
a sample .jsp file index.jsp. This file `src/main/webapp/index.jsp`
should be deleted.

[[BookTutorials-ConfigurationofCXF]]
Configuration of CXF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cxf-config.xml is as follows:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:jaxws="http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
            http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws http://cxf.apache.org/schemas/jaxws.xsd">

    <import resource="classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf-extension-soap.xml"/>
    <import resource="classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf-servlet.xml"/>

    <!-- implementation of the webservice -->
    <bean id="reportIncidentEndpoint" class="org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentEndpointImpl"/>

    <!-- export the webservice using jaxws -->
    <jaxws:endpoint id="reportIncident"
                    implementor="#reportIncidentEndpoint"
                    address="/incident"
                    wsdlLocation="/WEB-INF/wsdl/report_incident.wsdl"
                    endpointName="s:ReportIncidentPort"
                    serviceName="s:ReportIncidentService"
                    xmlns:s="http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org"/>

</beans>
----

The configuration is standard link:cxf.html[CXF] and is documented at
the http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF website].

The 3 import elements is needed by CXF and they must be in the file.

Noticed that we have a spring bean *reportIncidentEndpoint* that is the
implementation of the webservice endpoint we let CXF expose. +
Its linked from the jaxws element with the implementator attribute as we
use the # mark to identify its a reference to a spring bean. We could
have stated the classname directly as
`implementor="org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentEndpoint"`
but then we lose the ability to let the ReportIncidentEndpoint be
configured by spring. +
The *address* attribute defines the relative part of the URL of the
exposed webservice. *wsdlLocation* is an optional parameter but for
persons like me that likes contract-first we want to expose our own
.wsdl contracts and not the auto generated by the frameworks, so with
this attribute we can link to the real .wsdl file. The last stuff is
needed by CXF as you could have several services so it needs to know
which this one is. Configuring these is quite easy as all the
information is in the wsdl already.

[[BookTutorials-ImplementingtheReportIncidentEndpoint]]
Implementing the ReportIncidentEndpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Phew after all these meta files its time for some java code so we should
code the implementor of the webservice. So we fire up `mvn compile` to
let CXF generate the POJO classes for our webservice and we are ready to
fire up a Java editor.

You can use `mvn idea:idea` or `mvn eclipse:eclipse` to create project
files for these editors so you can load the project. However IDEA has
been smarter lately and can load a pom.xml directly.

As we want to quickly see our webservice we implement just a quick and
dirty as it can get. At first beware that since its jaxws and Java 1.5
we get annotations for the money, but they reside on the interface so we
can remove them from our implementations so its a nice plain POJO again:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
package org.apache.camel.example.reportincident;

/**
 * The webservice we have implemented.
 */
public class ReportIncidentEndpointImpl implements ReportIncidentEndpoint {

    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        System.out.println("Hello ReportIncidentEndpointImpl is called from " + parameters.getGivenName());

        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }

}
----

We just output the person that invokes this webservice and returns a OK
response. This class should be in the maven source root folder
`src/main/java` under the package name
`org.apache.camel.example.reportincident`. Beware that the maven
archetype tool didn't create the `src/main/java folder`, so you should
create it manually.

To test if we are home free we run `mvn clean compile`.

[[BookTutorials-Runningourwebservice]]
Running our webservice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that the code compiles we would like to run it inside a web
container, for this purpose we make use of Jetty which we will bootstrap
using it's plugin `org.mortbay.jetty:maven-jetty-plugin`:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
       <build>
           <plugins>
               ...
               <!-- so we can run mvn jetty:run -->
               <plugin>
                   <groupId>org.mortbay.jetty</groupId>
                   <artifactId>maven-jetty-plugin</artifactId>
                   <version>${jetty-version}</version>
               </plugin>
----

*Notice:* We make use of the Jetty version being defined inside the
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/parent/pom.xml[Camel's
Parent POM].

So to see if everything is in order we fire up jetty with
`mvn jetty:run` and if everything is okay you should be able to access
`http://localhost:8080`. +
Jetty is smart that it will list the correct URI on the page to our web
application, so just click on the link. This is smart as you don't have
to remember the exact web context URI for your application - just fire
up the default page and Jetty will help you.

So where is the damn webservice then? Well as we did configure the
web.xml to instruct the CXF servlet to accept the pattern
`/webservices/*` we should hit this URL to get the attention of CXF:
`http://localhost:8080/camel-example-reportincident/webservices`. +
image:book-tutorials.data/tutorial_reportincident_cxf_servicelist2.png[image] +
Â 

[[BookTutorials-Hittingthewebservice]]
Hitting the webservice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we have the webservice running in a standard .war application in a
standard web container such as Jetty we would like to invoke the
webservice and see if we get our code executed. Unfortunately this isn't
the easiest task in the world - its not so easy as a REST URL, so we
need tools for this. So we fire up our trusty webservice tool
http://www.soapui.org/[SoapUI] and let it be the one to fire the
webservice request and see the response.

Using SoapUI we sent a request to our webservice and we got the expected
OK response and the console outputs the System.out so we are ready to
code. +
image:book-tutorials.data/tutorial_reportincident_soapui2.png[image] +
Â 

[[BookTutorials-RemoteDebugging]]
Remote Debugging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Okay a little sidestep but wouldn't it be cool to be able to debug your
code when its fired up under Jetty? As Jetty is started from maven, we
need to instruct maven to use debug mode. +
Se we set the `MAVEN_OPTS` environment to start in debug mode and listen
on port 5005.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005
----

Then you need to restart Jetty so its stopped with *ctrl + c*. Remember
to start a new shell to pickup the new environment settings. And start
jetty again.

Then we can from our IDE attach a remote debugger and debug as we
want. +
First we configure IDEA to attach to a remote debugger on port 5005: +
image:book-tutorials.data/tutorial_reportincident_remotedebug_idea_setup2.png[image] +
Â 

Then we set a breakpoint in our code `ReportIncidentEndpoint` and hit
the SoapUI once again and we are breaked at the breakpoint where we can
inspect the parameters: +
image:book-tutorials.data/tutorial_reportincident_remotedebug_idea_breakpoint2.png[image] +
Â 

[[BookTutorials-Addingaunittest]]
Adding a unit test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Oh so much hard work just to hit a webservice, why can't we just use an
unit test to invoke our webservice? Yes of course we can do this, and
that's the next step. +
First we create the folder structure `src/test/java` and
`src/test/resources`. We then create the unit test in the
`src/test/java` folder.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
package org.apache.camel.example.reportincident;

import junit.framework.TestCase;

/**
 * Plain JUnit test of our webservice.
 */
public class ReportIncidentEndpointTest extends TestCase {

}
----

Here we have a plain old JUnit class. As we want to test webservices we
need to start and expose our webservice in the unit test before we can
test it. And JAXWS has pretty decent methods to help us here, the code
is simple as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    import javax.xml.ws.Endpoint;
    ...

    private static String ADDRESS = "http://localhost:9090/unittest";

    protected void startServer() throws Exception {
        // We need to start a server that exposes or webservice during the unit testing
        // We use jaxws to do this pretty simple
        ReportIncidentEndpointImpl server = new ReportIncidentEndpointImpl();
        Endpoint.publish(ADDRESS, server);
    }
----

The Endpoint class is the `javax.xml.ws.Endpoint` that under the covers
looks for a provider and in our case its CXF - so its CXF that does the
heavy lifting of exposing out webservice on the given URL address. Since
our class ReportIncidentEndpointImpl implements the interface
*ReportIncidentEndpoint* that is decorated with all the jaxws
annotations it got all the information it need to expose the webservice.
Below is the CXF wsdl2java generated interface:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----

/*
 * 
 */

package org.apache.camel.example.reportincident;

import javax.jws.WebMethod;
import javax.jws.WebParam;
import javax.jws.WebResult;
import javax.jws.WebService;
import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding;
import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle;
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlSeeAlso;

/**
 * This class was generated by Apache CXF 2.1.1
 * Wed Jul 16 12:40:31 CEST 2008
 * Generated source version: 2.1.1
 * 
 */
 
 /*
  * 
  */


@WebService(targetNamespace = "http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org", name = "ReportIncidentEndpoint")
@XmlSeeAlso({ObjectFactory.class})
@SOAPBinding(parameterStyle = SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle.BARE)

public interface ReportIncidentEndpoint {

/*
 * 
 */

    @SOAPBinding(parameterStyle = SOAPBinding.ParameterStyle.BARE)
    @WebResult(name = "outputReportIncident", targetNamespace = "http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org", partName = "parameters")
    @WebMethod(operationName = "ReportIncident", action = "http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org/ReportIncident")
    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(
        @WebParam(partName = "parameters", name = "inputReportIncident", targetNamespace = "http://reportincident.example.camel.apache.org")
        InputReportIncident parameters
    );
}
----

Next up is to create a webservice client so we can invoke our
webservice. For this we actually use the CXF framework directly as its a
bit more easier to create a client using this framework than using the
JAXWS style. We could have done the same for the server part, and you
should do this if you need more power and access more advanced features.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    import org.apache.cxf.jaxws.JaxWsProxyFactoryBean;
    ...
    
    protected ReportIncidentEndpoint createCXFClient() {
        // we use CXF to create a client for us as its easier than JAXWS and works
        JaxWsProxyFactoryBean factory = new JaxWsProxyFactoryBean();
        factory.setServiceClass(ReportIncidentEndpoint.class);
        factory.setAddress(ADDRESS);
        return (ReportIncidentEndpoint) factory.create();
    }
----

So now we are ready for creating a unit test. We have the server and the
client. So we just create a plain simple unit test method as the usual
junit style:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void testRendportIncident() throws Exception {
        startServer();

        ReportIncidentEndpoint client = createCXFClient();

        InputReportIncident input = new InputReportIncident();
        input.setIncidentId("123");
        input.setIncidentDate("2008-07-16");
        input.setGivenName("Claus");
        input.setFamilyName("Ibsen");
        input.setSummary("bla bla");
        input.setDetails("more bla bla");
        input.setEmail("davsclaus@apache.org");
        input.setPhone("+45 2962 7576");

        OutputReportIncident out = client.reportIncident(input);
        assertEquals("Response code is wrong", "OK", out.getCode());
    }
----

Now we are nearly there. But if you run the unit test with `mvn test`
then it will fail. Why!!! Well its because that CXF needs is missing
some dependencies during unit testing. In fact it needs the web
container, so we need to add this to our *pom.xml*.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <!-- cxf web container for unit testing -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
        <artifactId>cxf-rt-transports-http-jetty</artifactId>
        <version>${cxf-version}</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
----

Well what is that, CXF also uses Jetty for unit test - well its just
shows how agile, embedable and popular Jetty is.

So lets run our junit test with, and it reports:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn test
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Yep thats it for now. We have a basic project setup.

Maven, Spring, JAXWS and Apache CXF stuff. Its stuff that is well
covered on the net, but I wanted a full fledged tutorial on a maven
project setup that is web service ready with Apache CXF. We will use
this as a base for the next part where we demonstrate how Camel can be
digested slowly and piece by piece just as it was back in the times when
was introduced and was learning the Spring framework that we take for

That's it, only *one* dependency for now.

**Synchronize IDE**

If you continue from part 1, remember to update your editor project
settings since we have introduce new .jar files. For instance IDEA has a
feature to synchronize with Maven projects.

Now we turn towards our webservice endpoint implementation where we want
to let Camel have a go at the input we receive. As Camel is very non
invasive its basically a .jar file then we can just grap Camel but
creating a new instance of `DefaultCamelContext` that is the hearth of
Camel its context.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
CamelContext camel = new DefaultCamelContext();
----

In fact we create a constructor in our webservice and add this code:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private CamelContext camel;

    public ReportIncidentEndpointImpl() throws Exception {
        // create the camel context that is the "heart" of Camel
        camel = new DefaultCamelContext();

        // add the log component
        camel.addComponent("log", new LogComponent());

        // start Camel
        camel.start();
    }
----

[[BookTutorials-Loggingthe"HelloWorld"]]
Logging the "Hello World"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here at first we want Camel to log the *givenName* and *familyName*
parameters we receive, so we add the `LogComponent` with the key *log*.
And we must *start* Camel before its ready to act.

**Component Documentation**

The link:log.html[Log] and link:file2.html[File] components is
documented as well, just click on the links. Just return to this
documentation later when you must use these components for real.

Then we change the code in the method that is invoked by Apache CXF when
a webservice request arrives. We get the name and let Camel have a go at
it in the new method we create *sendToCamel*:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        String name = parameters.getGivenName() + " " + parameters.getFamilyName();

        // let Camel do something with the name
        sendToCamelLog(name);

        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }
----

Next is the Camel code. At first it looks like there are many code lines
to do a simple task of logging the name - yes it is. But later you will
in fact realize this is one of Camels true power. Its concise API. Hint:
The same code can be used for *any* component in Camel.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private void sendToCamelLog(String name) {
        try {
            // get the log component
            Component component = camel.getComponent("log");

            // create an endpoint and configure it.
            // Notice the URI parameters this is a common pratice in Camel to configure
            // endpoints based on URI.
            // com.mycompany.part2 = the log category used. Will log at INFO level as default
            Endpoint endpoint = component.createEndpoint("log:com.mycompany.part2");

            // create an Exchange that we want to send to the endpoint
            Exchange exchange = endpoint.createExchange();
            // set the in message payload (=body) with the name parameter
            exchange.getIn().setBody(name);

            // now we want to send the exchange to this endpoint and we then need a producer
            // for this, so we create and start the producer.
            Producer producer = endpoint.createProducer();
            producer.start();
            // process the exchange will send the exchange to the log component, that will process
            // the exchange and yes log the payload
            producer.process(exchange);

            // stop the producer, we want to be nice and cleanup
            producer.stop();




        } catch (Exception e) {
            // we ignore any exceptions and just rethrow as runtime
            throw new RuntimeException(e);

        }
    }
----

Okay there are code comments in the code block above that should explain
what is happening. We run the code by invoking our unit test with maven
`mvn test`, and we should get this log line:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
INFO: Exchange[BodyType:String, Body:Claus Ibsen]
----

[[BookTutorials-Writetofile-easywiththesamecodestyle]]
Write to file - easy with the same code style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay that isn't to impressive, Camel can log
image:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/s/en_GB/5997/6f42626d00e36f53fe51440403446ca61552e2a2.1/_/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png[(wink)]
Well I promised that the above code style can be used for *any*
component, so let's store the payload in a file. We do this by adding
the file component to the Camel context

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // add the file component
        camel.addComponent("file", new FileComponent());
----

And then we let camel write the payload to the file after we have
logged, by creating a new method *sendToCamelFile*. We want to store the
payload in filename with the incident id so we need this parameter also:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // let Camel do something with the name
        sendToCamelLog(name);
        sendToCamelFile(parameters.getIncidentId(), name);
----

And then the code that is 99% identical. We have change the URI
configuration when we create the endpoint as we pass in configuration
parameters to the file component. +
And then we need to set the output filename and this is done by adding a
special header to the exchange. That's the only difference:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private void sendToCamelFile(String incidentId, String name) {
        try {
            // get the file component
            Component component = camel.getComponent("file");

            // create an endpoint and configure it.
            // Notice the URI parameters this is a common pratice in Camel to configure
            // endpoints based on URI.
            // file://target instructs the base folder to output the files. We put in the target folder
            // then its actumatically cleaned by mvn clean
            Endpoint endpoint = component.createEndpoint("file://target");

            // create an Exchange that we want to send to the endpoint
            Exchange exchange = endpoint.createExchange();
            // set the in message payload (=body) with the name parameter
            exchange.getIn().setBody(name);

            // now a special header is set to instruct the file component what the output filename
            // should be
            exchange.getIn().setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, "incident-" + incidentId + ".txt");

            // now we want to send the exchange to this endpoint and we then need a producer
            // for this, so we create and start the producer.
            Producer producer = endpoint.createProducer();
            producer.start();
            // process the exchange will send the exchange to the file component, that will process
            // the exchange and yes write the payload to the given filename
            producer.process(exchange);

            // stop the producer, we want to be nice and cleanup
            producer.stop();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // we ignore any exceptions and just rethrow as runtime
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
----

After running our unit test again with `mvn test` we have a output file
in the target folder:

[[BookTutorials-Fullyjavabasedconfigurationofendpoints]]
Fully java based configuration of endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the file example above the configuration was URI based. What if you
want 100% java setter based style, well this is of course also possible.
We just need to cast to the component specific endpoint and then we have
all the setters available:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
            // create the file endpoint, we cast to FileEndpoint because then we can do
            // 100% java settter based configuration instead of the URI sting based
            // must pass in an empty string, or part of the URI configuration if wanted 
            FileEndpoint endpoint = (FileEndpoint)component.createEndpoint("");
            endpoint.setFile(new File("target/subfolder"));
            endpoint.setAutoCreate(true);
----

That's it. Now we have used the setters to configure the `FileEndpoint`
that it should store the file in the folder target/subfolder. Of course
Camel now stores the file in the subfolder.

[[BookTutorials-Lessonslearned]]
Lessons learned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay I wanted to demonstrate how you can be in 100% control of the
configuration and usage of Camel based on plain Java code with no hidden
magic or special *XML* or other configuration files. Just add the
camel-core.jar and you are ready to go.

You must have noticed that the code for sending a message to a given
endpoint is the same for both the *log* and *file*, in fact *any* Camel
endpoint. You as the client shouldn't bother with component specific
code such as file stuff for file components, jms stuff for JMS messaging
etc. This is what the link:message-endpoint.html[Message Endpoint] EIP
pattern is all about and Camel solves this very very nice - a key
pattern in Camel.

[[BookTutorials-Reducingcodelines]]
Reducing code lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have been introduced to Camel and one of its masterpiece
patterns solved elegantly with the link:message-endpoint.html[Message
Endpoint] its time to give productive and show a solution in fewer code
lines, in fact we can get it down to 5, 4, 3, 2 .. yes only *1 line of
code*.

The key is the *ProducerTemplate* that is a Spring'ish xxxTemplate based
producer. Meaning that it has methods to send messages to any Camel
endpoints. First of all we need to get hold of such a template and this
is done from the CamelContext

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private ProducerTemplate template;

    public ReportIncidentEndpointImpl() throws Exception {
        ...

        // get the ProducerTemplate thst is a Spring'ish xxxTemplate based producer for very
        // easy sending exchanges to Camel.
        template = camel.createProducerTemplate();

        // start Camel
        camel.start();
    }
----

Now we can use *template* for sending payloads to any endpoint in Camel.
So all the logging gabble can be reduced to:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    template.sendBody("log:com.mycompany.part2.easy", name);
----

And the same goes for the file, but we must also send the header to
instruct what the output filename should be:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    String filename = "easy-incident-" + incidentId + ".txt";
    template.sendBodyAndHeader("file://target/subfolder", name, FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, filename);
----

[[BookTutorials-Reducingevenmorecodelines]]
Reducing even more code lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well we got the Camel code down to 1-2 lines for sending the message to
the component that does all the heavy work of wring the message to a
file etc. But we still got 5 lines to initialize Camel.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    camel = new DefaultCamelContext();
    camel.addComponent("log", new LogComponent());
    camel.addComponent("file", new FileComponent());
    template = camel.createProducerTemplate();
    camel.start();
----

This can also be reduced. All the standard components in Camel is auto
discovered on-the-fly so we can remove these code lines and we are down
to 3 lines.

**Component auto discovery**

When an endpoint is requested with a scheme that Camel hasn't seen
before it will try to look for it in the classpath. It will do so by
looking for special Camel component marker files that reside in the
folder `META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/component`. If there are
files in this folder it will read them as the filename is the *scheme*
part of the URL. For instance the *log* component is defined in this
file `META-INF/services/org/apache/component/log` and its content is:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
class=org.apache.camel.component.log.LogComponent
----

The class property defines the component implementation.

*Tip:* End-users can create their 3rd party components using the same
technique and have them been auto discovered on-the-fly.

Okay back to the 3 code lines:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    camel = new DefaultCamelContext();
    template = camel.createProducerTemplate();
    camel.start();
----

Later will we see how we can reduce this to ... in fact 0 java code
lines. But the 3 lines will do for now.

[[BookTutorials-MessageTranslation]]
Message Translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay lets head back to the over goal of the integration. Looking at the
EIP diagrams at the introduction page we need to be able to translate
the incoming webservice to an email. Doing so we need to create the
email body. When doing the message translation we could put up our
sleeves and do it manually in pure java with a StringBuilder such as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private String createMailBody(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append("Incident ").append(parameters.getIncidentId());
        sb.append(" has been reported on the ").append(parameters.getIncidentDate());
        sb.append(" by ").append(parameters.getGivenName());
        sb.append(" ").append(parameters.getFamilyName());
        
        // and the rest of the mail body with more appends to the string builder
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
----

But as always it is a hardcoded template for the mail body and the code
gets kinda ugly if the mail message has to be a bit more advanced. But
of course it just works out-of-the-box with just classes already in the
JDK.

Lets use a template language instead such as
http://velocity.apache.org/[Apache Velocity]. As Camel have a component
for link:velocity.html[Velocity] integration we will use this component.
Looking at the link:component.html[Component List] overview we can see
that camel-velocity component uses the artifactId *camel-velocity* so
therefore we need to add this to the *pom.xml*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
            <artifactId>camel-velocity</artifactId>
            <version>${camel-version}</version>
        </dependency>
----

And now we have a Spring conflict as Apache CXF is dependent on Spring
2.0.8 and camel-velocity is dependent on Spring 2.5.5. To remedy this we
could wrestle with the *pom.xml* with excludes settings in the
dependencies or just bring in another dependency *camel-spring*:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
            <artifactId>camel-spring</artifactId>
            <version>${camel-version}</version>
        </dependency>
----

In fact camel-spring is such a vital part of Camel that you will end up
using it in nearly all situations - we will look into how well Camel is
seamless integration with Spring in part 3. For now its just another
dependency.

We create the mail body with the Velocity template and create the file
`src/main/resources/MailBody.vm`. The content in the *MailBody.vm* file
is:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
Incident $body.incidentId has been reported on the $body.incidentDate by $body.givenName $body.familyName.

The person can be contact by:
- email: $body.email
- phone: $body.phone

Summary: $body.summary

Details:
$body.details

This is an auto generated email. You can not reply.
----

Letting Camel creating the mail body and storing it as a file is as easy
as the following 3 code lines:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private void generateEmailBodyAndStoreAsFile(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        // generate the mail body using velocity template
        // notice that we just pass in our POJO (= InputReportIncident) that we
        // got from Apache CXF to Velocity.
        Object response = template.sendBody("velocity:MailBody.vm", parameters);
        // Note: the response is a String and can be cast to String if needed

        // store the mail in a file
        String filename = "mail-incident-" + parameters.getIncidentId() + ".txt";
        template.sendBodyAndHeader("file://target/subfolder", response, FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, filename);
    }
----

What is impressive is that we can just pass in our POJO object we got
from Apache CXF to Velocity and it will be able to generate the mail
body with this object in its context. Thus we don't need to prepare
*anything* before we let Velocity loose and generate our mail body.
Notice that the *template* method returns a object with out response.
This object contains the mail body as a String object. We can cast to
String if needed.

If we run our unit test with `mvn test` we can in fact see that Camel
has produced the file and we can type its content:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
D:\demo\part-two>type target\subfolder\mail-incident-123.txt
Incident 123 has been reported on the 2008-07-16 by Claus Ibsen.

[[BookTutorials-Firstpartofthesolution]]
First part of the solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What we have seen here is actually what it takes to build the first part
of the integration flow. Receiving a request from a webservice,
transform it to a mail body and store it to a file, and return an OK
response to the webservice. All possible within 10 lines of code. So
lets wrap it up here is what it takes:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
/**

 */
public class ReportIncidentEndpointImpl implements ReportIncidentEndpoint {

    private CamelContext camel;
    private ProducerTemplate template;

    public ReportIncidentEndpointImpl() throws Exception {
        // create the camel context that is the "heart" of Camel
        camel = new DefaultCamelContext();

        // get the ProducerTemplate thst is a Spring'ish xxxTemplate based producer for very
        // easy sending exchanges to Camel.
        template = camel.createProducerTemplate();

        // start Camel
        camel.start();
    }

    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        // transform the request into a mail body
        Object mailBody = template.sendBody("velocity:MailBody.vm", parameters);

        // store the mail body in a file
        String filename = "mail-incident-" + parameters.getIncidentId() + ".txt";
        template.sendBodyAndHeader("file://target/subfolder", mailBody, FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, filename);

        // return an OK reply
        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }

}
----

Okay I missed by one, its in fact only *9 lines of java code and 2
fields*.

[[BookTutorials-Endofpart2]]
End of part 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I know this is a bit different introduction to Camel to how you can
start using it in your projects just as a plain java .jar framework that
isn't invasive at all. I took you through the coding parts that requires
6 - 10 lines to send a message to an endpoint, buts it's important to
show the link:message-endpoint.html[Message Endpoint] EIP pattern in
action and how its implemented in Camel. Yes of course Camel also has to
one liners that you can use, and will use in your projects for sending
messages to endpoints. This part has been about good old plain java,
nothing fancy with Spring, XML files, auto discovery, OGSi or other new
technologies. I wanted to demonstrate the basic building blocks in Camel
and how its setup in pure god old fashioned Java. There are plenty of
eye catcher examples with one liners that does more than you can imagine
- we will come there in the later parts.

Okay part 3 is about building the last pieces of the solution and now it
gets interesting since we have to wrestle with the event driven
consumer. +
Brew a cup of coffee, tug the kids and kiss the wife, for now we will
have us some fun with the Camel. See you in part 3.

Recap
~~~~~

Lets just recap on the solution we have now:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public class ReportIncidentEndpointImpl implements ReportIncidentEndpoint {

    private CamelContext camel;
    private ProducerTemplate template;

    public ReportIncidentEndpointImpl() throws Exception {
        // create the camel context that is the "heart" of Camel
        camel = new DefaultCamelContext();

        // get the ProducerTemplate thst is a Spring'ish xxxTemplate based producer for very
        // easy sending exchanges to Camel.
        template = camel.createProducerTemplate();

        // start Camel
        camel.start();
    }

    /**
     * This is the last solution displayed that is the most simple
     */
    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        // transform the request into a mail body
        Object mailBody = template.sendBody("velocity:MailBody.vm", parameters);

        // store the mail body in a file
        String filename = "mail-incident-" + parameters.getIncidentId() + ".txt";
        template.sendBodyAndHeader("file://target/subfolder", mailBody, FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, filename);

        // return an OK reply
        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }

}
----

This completes the first part of the solution: receiving the message
using webservice, transform it to a mail body and store it as a text
file. +
What is missing is the last part that polls the text files and send them
as emails. Here is where some fun starts, as this requires usage of the
link:event-driven-consumer.html[Event Driven Consumer] EIP pattern to
react when new files arrives. So lets see how we can do this in Camel.
There is a saying: Many roads lead to Rome, and that is also true for
Camel - there are many ways to do it in Camel.

[[BookTutorials-Addingthe]]
Adding the link:event-driven-consumer.html[Event Driven Consumer]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We want to add the consumer to our integration that listen for new
files, we do this by creating a private method where the consumer code
lives. We must register our consumer in Camel before its started so we
need to add, and there fore we call the method *addMailSenderConsumer*
in the constructor below:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public ReportIncidentEndpointImpl() throws Exception {
        // create the camel context that is the "heart" of Camel
        camel = new DefaultCamelContext();

        // get the ProducerTemplate thst is a Spring'ish xxxTemplate based producer for very
        // easy sending exchanges to Camel.
        template = camel.createProducerTemplate();

        // add the event driven consumer that will listen for mail files and process them
        addMailSendConsumer();

        // start Camel
        camel.start();
    }
----

The consumer needs to be consuming from an endpoint so we grab the
endpoint from Camel we want to consume. It's `file://target/subfolder`.
Don't be fooled this endpoint doesn't have to 100% identical to the
producer, i.e. the endpoint we used in the previous part to create and
store the files. We could change the URL to include some options, and to
make it more clear that it's possible we setup a delay value to 10
seconds, and the first poll starts after 2 seconds. This is done by
adding `?consumer.delay=10000&consumer.initialDelay=2000` to the URL.

**URL Configuration**

The URL configuration in Camel link:endpoint.html[endpoints] is just
like regular URL we know from the Internet. You use ? and & to set the
options.

When we have the endpoint we can create the consumer (just as in part 1
where we created a producer}. Creating the consumer requires a
link:processor.html[Processor] where we implement the java code what
should happen when a message arrives. To get the mail body as a String
object we can use the *getBody* method where we can provide the type we
want in return.

**Camel Type Converter**

Why don't we just cast it as we always do in Java? Well the biggest
advantage when you provide the type as a parameter you tell Camel what
type you want and Camel can automatically convert it for you, using its
flexible link:type-converter.html[Type Converter] mechanism. This is a
great advantage, and you should try to use this instead of regular type
casting.

Sending the email is still left to be implemented, we will do this
later. And finally we must remember to start the consumer otherwise its
not active and won't listen for new files.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private void addMailSendConsumer() throws Exception {
        // Grab the endpoint where we should consume. Option - the first poll starts after 2 seconds
        Endpoint endpint = camel.getEndpoint("file://target/subfolder?consumer.initialDelay=2000");

        // create the event driven consumer
        // the Processor is the code what should happen when there is an event
        // (think it as the onMessage method)
        Consumer consumer = endpint.createConsumer(new Processor() {
            public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                // get the mail body as a String
                String mailBody = exchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);

                // okay now we are read to send it as an email
                System.out.println("Sending email..." + mailBody);
            }
        });

        // star the consumer, it will listen for files
        consumer.start();
    }
----

Before we test it we need to be aware that our unit test is only
catering for the first part of the solution, receiving the message with
webservice, transforming it using Velocity and then storing it as a file
- it doesn't test the link:event-driven-consumer.html[Event Driven
Consumer] we just added. As we are eager to see it in action, we just do
a common trick adding some sleep in our unit test, that gives our
link:event-driven-consumer.html[Event Driven Consumer] time to react and
print to System.out. We will later refine the test:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void testRendportIncident() throws Exception {
       ...

        OutputReportIncident out = client.reportIncident(input);
        assertEquals("Response code is wrong", "OK", out.getCode());

        // give the event driven consumer time to react
        Thread.sleep(10 * 1000);
    }
----

We run the test with `mvn clean test` and have eyes fixed on the console
output. +
During all the output in the console, we see that our consumer has been
triggered, as we want.

[[BookTutorials-Sendingtheemail]]
Sending the email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sending the email requires access to a SMTP mail server, but the
implementation code is very simple:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private void sendEmail(String body) {
        // send the email to your mail server
        String url = "smtp://someone@localhost?password=secret&to=incident@mycompany.com";
        template.sendBodyAndHeader(url, body, "subject", "New incident reported");
    }
----

And just invoke the method from our consumer:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    // okay now we are read to send it as an email
    System.out.println("Sending email...");
    sendEmail(mailBody);
    System.out.println("Email sent");
----

[[BookTutorials-Unittestingmail]]
Unit testing mail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For unit testing the consumer part we will use a mock mail framework, so
we add this to our *pom.xml*:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <!-- unit testing mail using mock -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jvnet.mock-javamail</groupId>
            <artifactId>mock-javamail</artifactId>
            <version>1.7</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
----

Then we prepare our integration to run with or without the consumer
enabled. We do this to separate the route into the two parts:

* receive the webservice, transform and save mail file and return OK as
repose
* the consumer that listen for mail files and send them as emails

So we change the constructor code a bit:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public ReportIncidentEndpointImpl() throws Exception {
        init(true);
    }

    public ReportIncidentEndpointImpl(boolean enableConsumer) throws Exception {
        init(enableConsumer);
    }

    private void init(boolean enableConsumer) throws Exception {
        // create the camel context that is the "heart" of Camel
        camel = new DefaultCamelContext();

        // get the ProducerTemplate thst is a Spring'ish xxxTemplate based producer for very
        // easy sending exchanges to Camel.
        template = camel.createProducerTemplate();

        // add the event driven consumer that will listen for mail files and process them
        if (enableConsumer) {
            addMailSendConsumer();
        }

        // start Camel
        camel.start();
    }
----

Then remember to change the *ReportIncidentEndpointTest* to pass in
*false* in the `ReportIncidentEndpointImpl` constructor. +
And as always run `mvn clean test` to be sure that the latest code
changes works.

[[BookTutorials-Addingnewunittest]]
Adding new unit test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are now ready to add a new unit test that tests the consumer part so
we create a new test class that has the following code structure:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
/**
 * Plain JUnit test of our consumer.
 */
public class ReportIncidentConsumerTest extends TestCase {

    private ReportIncidentEndpointImpl endpoint;

    public void testConsumer() throws Exception {
        // we run this unit test with the consumer, hence the true parameter
        endpoint = new ReportIncidentEndpointImpl(true);
   }

}
----

As we want to test the consumer that it can listen for files, read the
file content and send it as an email to our mailbox we will test it by
asserting that we receive 1 mail in our mailbox and that the mail is the
one we expect. To do so we need to grab the mailbox with the mockmail
API. This is done as simple as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void testConsumer() throws Exception {
        // we run this unit test with the consumer, hence the true parameter
        endpoint = new ReportIncidentEndpointImpl(true);

        // get the mailbox
        Mailbox box = Mailbox.get("incident@mycompany.com");
        assertEquals("Should not have mails", 0, box.size());
----

How do we trigger the consumer? Well by creating a file in the folder it
listen for. So we could use plain java.io.File API to create the file,
but wait isn't there an smarter solution? ... yes Camel of course. Camel
can do amazing stuff in one liner codes with its ProducerTemplate, so we
need to get a hold of this baby. We expose this template in our
ReportIncidentEndpointImpl but adding this getter:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    protected ProducerTemplate getTemplate() {
        return template;
    }
----

Then we can use the template to create the file in *one code line*:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // drop a file in the folder that the consumer listen
        // here is a trick to reuse Camel! so we get the producer template and just
        // fire a message that will create the file for us
        endpoint.getTemplate().sendBodyAndHeader("file://target/subfolder?append=false", "Hello World",
            FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, "mail-incident-test.txt");
----

Then we just need to wait a little for the consumer to kick in and do
its work and then we should assert that we got the new mail. Easy as
just:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // let the consumer have time to run
        Thread.sleep(3 * 1000);

        // get the mock mailbox and check if we got mail ;)
        assertEquals("Should have got 1 mail", 1, box.size());
        assertEquals("Subject wrong", "New incident reported", box.get(0).getSubject());
        assertEquals("Mail body wrong", "Hello World", box.get(0).getContent());
    }
----

The final class for the unit test is:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
/**
 * Plain JUnit test of our consumer.
 */
public class ReportIncidentConsumerTest extends TestCase {

    private ReportIncidentEndpointImpl endpoint;

    public void testConsumer() throws Exception {
        // we run this unit test with the consumer, hence the true parameter
        endpoint = new ReportIncidentEndpointImpl(true);

        // get the mailbox
        Mailbox box = Mailbox.get("incident@mycompany.com");
        assertEquals("Should not have mails", 0, box.size());

        // drop a file in the folder that the consumer listen
        // here is a trick to reuse Camel! so we get the producer template and just
        // fire a message that will create the file for us
        endpoint.getTemplate().sendBodyAndHeader("file://target/subfolder?append=false", "Hello World",
            FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, "mail-incident-test.txt");

        // let the consumer have time to run
        Thread.sleep(3 * 1000);

        // get the mock mailbox and check if we got mail ;)
        assertEquals("Should have got 1 mail", 1, box.size());
        assertEquals("Subject wrong", "New incident reported", box.get(0).getSubject());
        assertEquals("Mail body wrong", "Hello World", box.get(0).getContent());
    }

}
----

[[BookTutorials-Endofpart3]]
End of part 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay we have reached the end of part 3. For now we have only scratched
the surface of what Camel is and what it can do. We have introduced
Camel into our integration piece by piece and slowly added more and more
along the way. And the most important is: *you as the developer never
lost control*. We hit a sweet spot in the webservice implementation
where we could write our java code. Adding Camel to the mix is just to
use it as a regular java code, nothing magic. We were in control of the
flow, we decided when it was time to translate the input to a mail body,
we decided when the content should be written to a file. This is very
important to not lose control, that the bigger and heavier frameworks
tend to do. No names mentioned, but boy do developers from time to time
dislike these elephants. And Camel is *no elephant*.

I suggest you download the samples from part 1 to 3 and try them out. It
is great basic knowledge to have in mind when we look at some of the
features where Camel really excel - *the routing domain language*.

From part 1 to 3 we touched concepts such as::

* link:configuring-camel.html[URI configuration]

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section is about regular Camel. The examples presented here in this
section is much more in common of all the examples we have in the Camel
documentation.

[[BookTutorials-Routing]]
Routing
~~~~~~~

Camel is particular strong as a light-weight and agile *routing* and
*mediation* framework. In this part we will introduce the *routing*
concept and how we can introduce this into our solution. +
Looking back at the figure from the
link:tutorial-example-reportincident.html[Introduction] page we want to
implement this routing. Camel has support for expressing this
link:routes.html[routing logic using Java] as a DSL (Domain Specific
Language). In fact Camel also has DSL for XML and Scala. In this part we
use the Java DSL as its the most powerful and all developers know Java.
Later we will introduce the XML version that is very well integrated
with Spring.

Before we jump into it, we want to state that this tutorial is about
*Developers not loosing control*. In my humble experience one of the key
fears of developers is that they are forced into a tool/framework where
they loose control and/or power, and the possible is now impossible. So
in this part we stay clear with this vision and our starting point is as
follows:

* We have generated the webservice source code using the CXF wsdl2java
generator and we have our ReportIncidentEndpointImpl.java file where we
as a Developer feels home and have the power.

So the starting point is:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
/**
 * The webservice we have implemented.
 */
public class ReportIncidentEndpointImpl implements ReportIncidentEndpoint {

    /**
     * This is the last solution displayed that is the most simple
     */
    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        // WE ARE HERE !!!
        return null;
    }

}
----

Yes we have a simple plain Java class where we have the implementation
of the webservice. The cursor is blinking at the WE ARE HERE block and
this is where we feel home. More or less any Java Developers have
implemented webservices using a stack such as: Apache AXIS, Apache CXF
or some other quite popular framework. They all allow the developer to
be in control and implement the code logic as plain Java code. Camel of
course doesn't enforce this to be any different. Okay the boss told us
to implement the solution from the figure in the Introduction page and
we are now ready to code.

[[BookTutorials-RouteBuilder]]
RouteBuilder
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*RouteBuilder* is the hearth in Camel of the Java DSL routing. This
class does all the heavy lifting of supporting EIP verbs for end-users
to express the routing. It does take a little while to get settled and
used to, but when you have worked with it for a while you will enjoy its
power and realize it is in fact a little language inside Java itself.
Camel is the *only* integration framework we are aware of that has Java
DSL, all the others are usually *only* XML based.

As an end-user you usually use the *RouteBuilder* as of follows:

* create your own Route class that extends *RouteBuilder*
* implement your routing DSL in the *configure* method

So we create a new class ReportIncidentRoutes and implement the first
part of the routing:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

public class ReportIncidentRoutes extends RouteBuilder {

    public void configure() throws Exception {
        // direct:start is a internal queue to kick-start the routing in our example
        // we use this as the starting point where you can send messages to direct:start
        from("direct:start")
            // to is the destination we send the message to our velocity endpoint
            // where we transform the mail body
            .to("velocity:MailBody.vm");
    }

}
----

What to notice here is the *configure* method. Here is where all the
action is. Here we have the Java DSL langauge, that is expressed using
the *fluent builder syntax* that is also known from Hibernate when you
build the dynamic queries etc. What you do is that you can stack methods
separating with the dot.

In the example above we have a very common routing, that can be
distilled from pseudo verbs to actual code with:

* from A to B
* From Endpoint A To Endpoint B
* from("endpointA").to("endpointB")
* from("direct:start").to("velocity:MailBody.vm");

*from("direct:start")* is the consumer that is kick-starting our routing
flow. It will wait for messages to arrive on the
link:direct.html[direct] queue and then dispatch the message. +
*to("velocity:MailBody.vm")* is the producer that will receive a message
and let Velocity generate the mail body response.

So what we have implemented so far with our ReportIncidentRoutes
RouteBuilder is this part of the picture: +
image:book-tutorials.data/tutorial_reportincident_route_1.png[image]

[[BookTutorials-AddingtheRouteBuilder]]
Adding the RouteBuilder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we have our RouteBuilder we need to add/connect it to our
CamelContext that is the hearth of Camel. So turning back to our
webservice implementation class ReportIncidentEndpointImpl we add this
constructor to the code, to create the CamelContext and add the routes
from our route builder and finally to start it.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private CamelContext context;

    public ReportIncidentEndpointImpl() throws Exception {
        // create the context
        context = new DefaultCamelContext();

        // append the routes to the context
        context.addRoutes(new ReportIncidentRoutes());

        // at the end start the camel context
        context.start();
    }
----

Okay how do you use the routes then? Well its just as before we use a
ProducerTemplate to send messages to Endpoints, so we just send to the
*direct:start* endpoint and it will take it from there. +
So we implement the logic in our webservice operation:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    /**
     * This is the last solution displayed that is the most simple
     */
    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        Object mailBody = context.createProducerTemplate().sendBody("direct:start", parameters);
        System.out.println("Body:" + mailBody);

        // return an OK reply
        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }
----

Notice that we get the producer template using the
*createProducerTemplate* method on the CamelContext. Then we send the
input parameters to the *direct:start* endpoint and it will route it
*to* the velocity endpoint that will generate the mail body. Since we
use *direct* as the consumer endpoint (=from) and its a *synchronous*
exchange we will get the response back from the route. And the response
is of course the output from the velocity endpoint.

**About creating ProducerTemplate**

In the example above we create a new `ProducerTemplate` when the
`reportIncident` method is invoked. However in reality you should only
create the template once and re-use it. See this
link:why-does-camel-use-too-many-threads-with-producertemplate.html[FAQ
entry].

We have now completed this part of the picture: +
image:book-tutorials.data/tutorial_reportincident_route_2b.png[image]

[[BookTutorials-Unittesting]]
Unit testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now is the time we would like to unit test what we got now. So we call
for camel and its great test kit. For this to work we need to add it to
the pom.xml

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
            <artifactId>camel-core</artifactId>
            <version>1.4.0</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
            <type>test-jar</type>
        </dependency>
----

After adding it to the pom.xml you should refresh your Java Editor so it
pickups the new jar. Then we are ready to create out unit test class. +
We create this unit test skeleton, where we *extend* this class
`ContextTestSupport`

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
package org.apache.camel.example.reportincident;

import org.apache.camel.ContextTestSupport;
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

/**
 * Unit test of our routes
 */
public class ReportIncidentRoutesTest extends ContextTestSupport {

}
----

`ContextTestSupport` is a supporting unit test class for much easier
unit testing with Apache Camel. The class is extending JUnit TestCase
itself so you get all its glory. What we need to do now is to somehow
tell this unit test class that it should use our route builder as this
is the one we gonna test. So we do this by implementing the
`createRouteBuilder` method.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    @Override
    protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
        return new ReportIncidentRoutes();
    }
----

That is easy just return an instance of our route builder and this unit
test will use our routes.

It is quite common in Camel itself to unit test using routes defined as
an anonymous inner class, such as illustrated below:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            public void configure() throws Exception {
                // TODO: Add your routes here, such as:
                from("jms:queue:inbox").to("file://target/out");
            }
        };
    }
----

The same technique is of course also possible for end-users of Camel to
create parts of your routes and test them separately in many test
classes. +
However in this tutorial we test the real route that is to be used for
production, so we just return an instance of the real one.

We then code our unit test method that sends a message to the route and
assert that its transformed to the mail body using the Velocity
template.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void testTransformMailBody() throws Exception {
        // create a dummy input with some input data
        InputReportIncident parameters = createInput();

        // send the message (using the sendBody method that takes a parameters as the input body)
        // to "direct:start" that kick-starts the route
        // the response is returned as the out object, and its also the body of the response
        Object out = context.createProducerTemplate().sendBody("direct:start", parameters);

        // convert the response to a string using camel converters. However we could also have casted it to
        // a string directly but using the type converters ensure that Camel can convert it if it wasn't a string
        // in the first place. The type converters in Camel is really powerful and you will later learn to
        // appreciate them and wonder why its not build in Java out-of-the-box
        String body = context.getTypeConverter().convertTo(String.class, out);

        // do some simple assertions of the mail body
        assertTrue(body.startsWith("Incident 123 has been reported on the 2008-07-16 by Claus Ibsen."));
    }

    /**
     * Creates a dummy request to be used for input
     */
    protected InputReportIncident createInput() {
        InputReportIncident input = new InputReportIncident();
        input.setIncidentId("123");
        input.setIncidentDate("2008-07-16");
        input.setGivenName("Claus");
        input.setFamilyName("Ibsen");
        input.setSummary("bla bla");
        input.setDetails("more bla bla");
        input.setEmail("davsclaus@apache.org");
        input.setPhone("+45 2962 7576");
        return input;
    }
----

[[BookTutorials-AddingtheFileBackup]]
Adding the File Backup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next piece of puzzle that is missing is to store the mail body as a
backup file. So we turn back to our route and the EIP patterns. We use
the link:pipes-and-filters.html[Pipes and Filters] pattern here to chain
the routing as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("direct:start")
            .to("velocity:MailBody.vm")
            // using pipes-and-filters we send the output from the previous to the next
            .to("file://target/subfolder");
     }
----

Notice that we just add a 2nd *.to* on the newline. Camel will default
use the link:pipes-and-filters.html[Pipes and Filters] pattern here when
there are multi endpoints chained liked this. We could have used the
*pipeline* verb to let out stand out that its the
link:pipes-and-filters.html[Pipes and Filters] pattern such as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        from("direct:start")
            // using pipes-and-filters we send the output from the previous to the next
            .pipeline("velocity:MailBody.vm", "file://target/subfolder");
----

But most people are using the multi *.to* style instead.

We re-run out unit test and verifies that it still passes:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
Running org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentRoutesTest
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.157 sec
----

But hey we have added the file _producer_ endpoint and thus a file
should also be created as the backup file. If we look in the
`target/subfolder` we can see that something happened. +
On my humble laptop it created this folder:
*target\subfolder\ID-claus-acer*. So the file producer create a sub
folder named `ID-claus-acer` what is this? Well Camel auto generates an
unique filename based on the unique message id if not given instructions
to use a fixed filename. In fact it creates another sub folder and name
the file as: target\subfolder\ID-claus-acer\3750-1219148558921\1-0 where
1-0 is the file with the mail body. What we want is to use our own
filename instead of this auto generated filename. This is archived by
adding a header to the message with the filename to use. So we need to
add this to our route and compute the filename based on the message
content.

[[BookTutorials-Settingthefilename]]
Setting the filename
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For starters we show the simple solution and build from there. We start
by setting a constant filename, just to verify that we are on the right
path, to instruct the file producer what filename to use. The file
producer uses a special header `FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME` to set
the filename.

What we do is to send the header when we "kick-start" the routing as the
header will be propagated from the direct queue to the file producer.
What we need to do is to use the `ProducerTemplate.sendBodyAndHeader`
method that takes *both* a body and a header. So we change out
webservice code to include the filename also:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        // create the producer template to use for sending messages
        ProducerTemplate producer = context.createProducerTemplate();
        // send the body and the filename defined with the special header key 
        Object mailBody = producer.sendBodyAndHeader("direct:start", parameters, FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, "incident.txt");
        System.out.println("Body:" + mailBody);

        // return an OK reply
        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }
----

However we could also have used the route builder itself to configure
the constant filename as shown below:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("direct:start")
            .to("velocity:MailBody.vm")
            // set the filename to a constant before the file producer receives the message
            .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, constant("incident.txt"))
            .to("file://target/subfolder");
     }
----

But Camel can be smarter and we want to dynamic set the filename based
on some of the input parameters, how can we do this? +
Well the obvious solution is to compute and set the filename from the
webservice implementation, but then the webservice implementation has
such logic and we want this decoupled, so we could create our own POJO
bean that has a method to compute the filename. We could then instruct
the routing to invoke this method to get the computed filename. This is
a string feature in Camel, its link:bean.html[Bean] binding. So lets
show how this can be done:

[[BookTutorials-Usingtocomputethefilename]]
Using link:bean-language.html[Bean Language] to compute the filename
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First we create our plain java class that computes the filename, and it
has 100% no dependencies to Camel what so ever.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
/**
 * Plain java class to be used for filename generation based on the reported incident
 */
public class FilenameGenerator {

    public String generateFilename(InputReportIncident input) {
        // compute the filename
        return "incident-" + input.getIncidentId() + ".txt";
    }

}
----

The class is very simple and we could easily create unit tests for it to
verify that it works as expected. So what we want now is to let Camel
invoke this class and its generateFilename with the input parameters and
use the output as the filename. Pheeeww is this really possible
out-of-the-box in Camel? Yes it is. So lets get on with the show. We
have the code that computes the filename, we just need to call it from
our route using the link:bean-language.html[Bean Language]:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("direct:start")
            // set the filename using the bean language and call the FilenameGenerator class.
            // the 2nd null parameter is optional methodname, to be used to avoid ambiguity.
            // if not provided Camel will try to figure out the best method to invoke, as we
            // only have one method this is very simple
            .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, BeanLanguage.bean(FilenameGenerator.class, null))
            .to("velocity:MailBody.vm")
            .to("file://target/subfolder");
    }
----

Notice that we use the *bean* language where we supply the class with
our bean to invoke. Camel will instantiate an instance of the class and
invoke the suited method. For completeness and ease of code readability
we add the method name as the 2nd parameter

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
            .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, BeanLanguage.bean(FilenameGenerator.class, "generateFilename"))
----

Then other developers can understand what the parameter is, instead of
`null`.

Now we have a nice solution, but as a sidetrack I want to demonstrate
the Camel has other languages out-of-the-box, and that scripting
language is a first class citizen in Camel where it etc. can be used in
content based routing. However we want it to be used for the filename
generation.

[[BookTutorials-Usingascriptlanguagetosetthefilename]]
Using a script language to set the filename
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We could do as in the previous parts where we send the computed filename
as a message header when we "kick-start" the route. But we want to learn
new stuff so we look for a different solution using some of Camels many
link:languages.html[Languages]. As link:ognl.html[OGNL] is a favorite
language of mine (used by WebWork) so we pick this baby for a Camel
ride. For starters we must add it to our pom.xml:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
            <artifactId>camel-ognl</artifactId>
            <version>${camel-version}</version>
        </dependency>
----

And remember to refresh your editor so you got the new .jars. +
We want to construct the filename based on this syntax:
`mail-incident-#ID#.txt` where #ID# is the incident id from the input
parameters. As link:ognl.html[OGNL] is a language that can invoke
methods on bean we can invoke the `getIncidentId()` on the message body
and then concat it with the fixed pre and postfix strings.

In link:ognl.html[OGNL] glory this is done as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
"'mail-incident-' + request.body.incidentId + '.txt'"
----

where `request.body.incidentId` computes to:

* *request* is the IN message. See the link:ognl.html[OGNL] for other
predefined objects available
* *body* is the body of the in message
* *incidentId* will invoke the `getIncidentId()` method on the body. +
The rest is just more or less regular plain code where we can concat
strings.

Now we got the expression to dynamic compute the filename on the fly we
need to set it on our route so we turn back to our route, where we can
add the OGNL expression:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("direct:start")
            // we need to set the filename and uses OGNL for this
            .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, OgnlExpression.ognl("'mail-incident-' + request.body.incidentId + '.txt'"))
            // using pipes-and-filters we send the output from the previous to the next
            .pipeline("velocity:MailBody.vm", "file://target/subfolder");
    }
----

And since we are on Java 1.5 we can use the static import of *ognl* so
we have:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
import static org.apache.camel.language.ognl.OgnlExpression.ognl;
...
    .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, ognl("'mail-incident-' + request.body.incidentId + '.txt'"))
----

Notice the import static also applies for all the other languages, such
as the link:bean-language.html[Bean Language] we used previously.

Whatever worked for you we have now implemented the backup of the data
files: +
image:book-tutorials.data/tutorial_reportincident_route_3.png[image]

[[BookTutorials-Sendingtheemail.1]]
Sending the email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What we need to do before the solution is completed is to actually send
the email with the mail body we generated and stored as a file. In the
previous part we did this with a link:file2.html[File] consumer, that we
manually added to the CamelContext. We can do this quite easily with the
routing.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

public class ReportIncidentRoutes extends RouteBuilder {

    public void configure() throws Exception {
        // first part from the webservice -> file backup
        from("direct:start")
            .setHeader(FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME, bean(FilenameGenerator.class, "generateFilename"))
            .to("velocity:MailBody.vm")
            .to("file://target/subfolder");

        // second part from the file backup -> send email
        from("file://target/subfolder")
            // set the subject of the email
            .setHeader("subject", constant("new incident reported"))
            // send the email
            .to("smtp://someone@localhost?password=secret&to=incident@mycompany.com");
    }

}
----

The last 3 lines of code does all this. It adds a file consumer
*from("file://target/subfolder")*, sets the mail subject, and finally
send it as an email.

The DSL is really powerful where you can express your routing
integration logic. +
So we completed the last piece in the picture puzzle with just 3 lines
of code.

We have now completed the integration: +

[[BookTutorials-BetterJMSTransportforCXFWebserviceusingApacheCamel]]
Better JMS Transport for CXF Webservice using Apache Camel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring JMS in Apache CXF before Version 2.1.3 is possible but not
really easy or nice. This article shows how to use Apache Camel to
provide a better JMS Transport for CXF.

*Update:* Since CXF 2.1.3 there is a new way of configuring JMS
(http://cxf.apache.org/docs/using-the-jmsconfigfeature.html[Using the
JMSConfigFeature]). It makes JMS config for CXF as easy as with Camel.
Using Camel for JMS is still a good idea if you want to use the rich
feature of Camel for routing and other Integration Scenarios that CXF
does not support.

http://www.liquid-reality.de/display/liquid/2008/08/25/Better+JMS+Transport+for+CXF+Webservice+using+Apache+Camel[You
can find the original announcement for this Tutorial and some additional
info on Christian SchneiderÂ´s Blog]

[[BookTutorials-SohowtoconnectApacheCamelandCXF]]
So how to connect Apache Camel and CXF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The best way to connect Camel and CXF is using the
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/camel-transport-for-cxf.html[Camel
transport for CXF]. This is a camel module that registers with cxf as a
new transport. It is quite easy to configure.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<bean class="org.apache.camel.component.cxf.transport.CamelTransportFactory">
  <property name="bus" ref="cxf" />
  <property name="camelContext" ref="camelContext" />
  <property name="transportIds">
    <list>
      <value>http://cxf.apache.org/transports/camel</value>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>
----

This bean registers with CXF and provides a new transport prefix
camel:// that can be used in CXF address configurations. The bean
references a bean cxf which will be already present in your config. The
other refrenceis a camel context. We will later define this bean to
provide the routing config.

[[BookTutorials-HowisJMSconfiguredinCamel]]
How is JMS configured in Camel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In camel you need two things to configure JMS. A ConnectionFactory and a
JMSComponent. As ConnectionFactory you can simply set up the normal
Factory your JMS provider offers or
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/xsd-config.html#xsd-config-body-schemas-jee-jndi-lookup-environment-single[bind
a JNDI ConnectionFactory]. In this example we use the ConnectionFactory
provided by ActiveMQ.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<bean id="jmsConnectionFactory" class="org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory">
  <property name="brokerURL" value="tcp://localhost:61616" />
</bean>
----

Then we set up the JMSComponent. It offers a new transport prefix to
camel that we simply call jms. If we need several JMSComponents we can
differentiate them by their name.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<bean id="jms" class="org.apache.camel.component.jms.JmsComponent">
  <property name="connectionFactory" ref="jmsConnectionFactory" />
  <property name="useMessageIDAsCorrelationID" value="true" />
</bean>
----

You can find more details about the
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/jms.html[JMSComponent at the Camel
Wiki]. For example you find the complete configuration options and a
JNDI sample there.

[[BookTutorials-SettinguptheCXFclient]]
Setting up the CXF client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will configure a simple CXF webservice client. It will use stub code
generated from a wsdl. The webservice client will be configured to use
JMS directly. You can also use a direct: Endpoint and do the routing to
JMS in the Camel Context.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<client id="CustomerService" xmlns="http://cxf.apache.org/jaxws" xmlns:customer="http://customerservice.example.com/"
  serviceName="customer:CustomerServiceService"
  endpointName="customer:CustomerServiceEndpoint"
  address="camel:jms:queue:CustomerService"
  serviceClass="com.example.customerservice.CustomerService">
</client>
----

We explicitly configure serviceName and endpointName so they are not
read from the wsdl. The names we use are arbitrary and have no further
function but we set them to look nice. The serviceclass points to the
service interface that was generated from the wsdl. Now the important
thing is address. Here we tell cxf to use the camel transport, use the
JmsComponent who registered the prefix "jms" and use the queue
"CustomerService".

[[BookTutorials-SettinguptheCamelContext]]
Setting up the CamelContext
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As we do not need additional routing an empty
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/spring.html[CamelContext] bean will
suffice.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<camelContext id="camelContext" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
</camelContext>
----

^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tutorial uses Maven 2 to setup the Camel project and for
dependencies for artifacts.

[[BookTutorials-Distribution.1]]
Distribution
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This sample is distributed with the Camel 1.5 distribution as
`examples/camel-example-axis`.

[[BookTutorials-Introduction.2]]
Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

http://ws.apache.org/axis/[Apache Axis] is/was widely used as a
webservice framework. So in line with some of the other tutorials to
demonstrate how Camel is not an invasive framework but is flexible and
integrates well with existing solution.

We have an existing solution that exposes a webservice using Axis 1.4
deployed as web applications. This is a common solution. We use contract
first so we have Axis generated source code from an existing wsdl file.
Then we show how we introduce Spring and Camel to integrate with Axis.

This tutorial uses the following frameworks:

* Maven 2.0.9
* Apache Camel 1.5.0
* Apache Axis 1.4
* Spring 2.5.5

[[BookTutorials-SettinguptheprojecttorunAxis]]
Setting up the project to run Axis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This first part is about getting the project up to speed with Axis. We
are not touching Camel or Spring at this time.

[[BookTutorials-Maven2]]
Maven 2
+++++++

Axis dependencies is available for maven 2 so we configure our pom.xml
as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]

Then we need to configure maven to use Java 1.5 and the Axis maven
plugin that generates the source code based on the wsdl file:

[[BookTutorials-ConfiguringAxis]]
Configuring Axis
++++++++++++++++

Okay we are now setup for the contract first development and can
generate the source file. For now we are still only using standard Axis
and not Spring nor Camel. We still need to setup Axis as a web
application so we configure the web.xml in
`src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml` as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>axis</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>org.apache.axis.transport.http.AxisServlet</servlet-class>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>axis</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/services/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
----

The web.xml just registers Axis servlet that is handling the incoming
web requests to its servlet mapping. We still need to configure Axis
itself and this is done using its special configuration file
`server-config.wsdd`. We nearly get this file for free if we let Axis
generate the source code so we run the maven goal:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn axistools:wsdl2java
----

The tool will generate the source code based on the wsdl and save the
files to the following folder:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
.\target\generated-sources\axistools\wsdl2java\org\apache\camel\example\reportincident
deploy.wsdd
InputReportIncident.java
OutputReportIncident.java
ReportIncidentBindingImpl.java
ReportIncidentBindingStub.java
ReportIncidentService_PortType.java
ReportIncidentService_Service.java
ReportIncidentService_ServiceLocator.java
undeploy.wsdd
----

This is standard Axis and so far no Camel or Spring has been touched. To
implement our webservice we will add our code, so we create a new class
`AxisReportIncidentService` that implements the port type interface
where we can implement our code logic what happens when the webservice
is invoked.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
package org.apache.camel.example.axis;

import org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.InputReportIncident;
import org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.OutputReportIncident;
import org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentService_PortType;

import java.rmi.RemoteException;

/**
 * Axis webservice
 */
public class AxisReportIncidentService implements ReportIncidentService_PortType {

    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) throws RemoteException {
        System.out.println("Hello AxisReportIncidentService is called from " + parameters.getGivenName());

        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }

}
----

Now we need to configure Axis itself and this is done using its
`server-config.wsdd` file. We nearly get this for for free from the auto
generated code, we copy the stuff from `deploy.wsdd` and made a few
modifications:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]

            <handler type="java:org.apache.axis.handlers.http.HTTPAuthHandler"/>
        </requestFlow>
    </transport>
</deployment>
----

The *globalConfiguration* and *transport* is not in the deploy.wsdd file
so you gotta write that yourself. The *service* is a 100% copy from
deploy.wsdd. Axis has more configuration to it than shown here, but then
you should check the http://ws.apache.org/axis/[Axis documentation].

What we need to do now is important, as we need to modify the above
configuration to use our webservice class than the default one, so we
change the classname parameter to our class *AxisReportIncidentService*:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<parameter name="className" value="org.apache.camel.example.axis.AxisReportIncidentService"/>
----

[[BookTutorials-RunningtheExample.1]]
Running the Example
+++++++++++++++++++

Now we are ready to run our example for the first time, so we use Jetty
as the quick web container using its maven command:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn jetty:run
----

Then we can hit the web browser and enter this URL:
`http://localhost:8080/camel-example-axis/services` and you should see
the famous Axis start page with the text *And now... Some Services*.

Clicking on the .wsdl link shows the wsdl file, but what. It's an auto
generated one and not our original .wsdl file. So we need to fix this
ASAP and this is done by configuring Axis in the server-config.wsdd
file:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
  <service name="ReportIncidentPort" provider="java:RPC" style="document" use="literal">
    <wsdlFile>/WEB-INF/wsdl/report_incident.wsdl</wsdlFile>
    ...
----

We do this by adding the wsdlFile tag in the service element where we
can point to the real .wsdl file.

[[BookTutorials-IntegratingSpring]]
Integrating Spring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First we need to add its dependencies to the *pom.xml*.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>
            <version>2.5.5</version>
        </dependency>
----

Spring is integrated just as it would like to, we add its listener to
the web.xml and a context parameter to be able to configure precisely
what spring xml files to use:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <context-param>
        <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
        <param-value>
            classpath:axis-example-context.xml
        </param-value>
    </context-param>

    <listener>
        <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
    </listener>
----

Next is to add a plain spring XML file named *axis-example-context.xml*
in the src/main/resources folder.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
         http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd">

</beans>
----

The spring XML file is currently empty. We hit jetty again with
`mvn jetty:run` just to make sure Spring was setup correctly.

[[BookTutorials-UsingSpring]]
Using Spring
++++++++++++

We would like to be able to get hold of the Spring ApplicationContext
from our webservice so we can get access to the glory spring, but how do
we do this? And our webservice class AxisReportIncidentService is
created and managed by Axis we want to let Spring do this. So we have
two problems.

We solve these problems by creating a delegate class that Axis creates,
and this delegate class gets hold on Spring and then gets our real
webservice as a spring bean and invoke the service.

First we create a new class that is 100% independent from Axis and just
a plain POJO. This is our real service.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
package org.apache.camel.example.axis;

import org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.InputReportIncident;
import org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.OutputReportIncident;

/**
 * Our real service that is not tied to Axis
 */
public class ReportIncidentService  {

    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        System.out.println("Hello ReportIncidentService is called from " + parameters.getGivenName());

        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }

}
----

So now we need to get from AxisReportIncidentService to this one
ReportIncidentService using Spring. Well first of all we add our real
service to spring XML configuration file so Spring can handle its
lifecycle:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
         http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd">
    
    <bean id="incidentservice" class="org.apache.camel.example.axis.ReportIncidentService"/>

</beans>
----

And then we need to modify AxisReportIncidentService to use Spring to
lookup the spring bean *id="incidentservice"* and delegate the call. We
do this by extending the spring class
`org.springframework.remoting.jaxrpc.ServletEndpointSupport` so the
refactored code is:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
package org.apache.camel.example.axis;

import org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.InputReportIncident;
import org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.OutputReportIncident;
import org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.ReportIncidentService_PortType;
import org.springframework.remoting.jaxrpc.ServletEndpointSupport;

import java.rmi.RemoteException;

/**
 * Axis webservice
 */
public class AxisReportIncidentService extends ServletEndpointSupport implements ReportIncidentService_PortType {

    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) throws RemoteException {
        // get hold of the spring bean from the application context
        ReportIncidentService service = (ReportIncidentService) getApplicationContext().getBean("incidentservice");

        // delegate to the real service
        return service.reportIncident(parameters);
    }

}
----

To see if everything is okay we run `mvn jetty:run`.

In the code above we get hold of our service at each request by looking
up in the application context. However Spring also supports an *init*
method where we can do this once. So we change the code to:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public class AxisReportIncidentService extends ServletEndpointSupport implements ReportIncidentService_PortType {

    private ReportIncidentService service;

    @Override
    protected void onInit() throws ServiceException {
        // get hold of the spring bean from the application context
        service = (ReportIncidentService) getApplicationContext().getBean("incidentservice");
    }

    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) throws RemoteException {
        // delegate to the real service
        return service.reportIncident(parameters);
    }

}
----

So now we have integrated Axis with Spring and we are ready for Camel.

[[BookTutorials-IntegratingCamel]]
Integrating Camel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Again the first step is to add the dependencies to the maven *pom.xml*
file:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
            <artifactId>camel-core</artifactId>
            <version>1.5.0</version>
        </dependency>

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
            <artifactId>camel-spring</artifactId>
            <version>1.5.0</version>
        </dependency>
----

Now that we have integrated with Spring then we easily integrate with
Camel as Camel works well with Spring.

**Camel does not require Spring**

Camel does not require Spring, we could easily have used Camel without
Spring, but most users prefer to use Spring also.

We choose to integrate Camel in the Spring XML file so we add the camel
namespace and the schema location:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
xmlns:camel="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring"
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd"
----

[[BookTutorials-CamelContext]]
CamelContext
++++++++++++

link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] is the heart of Camel its where all
the link:routes.html[routes], link:endpoint.html[endpoints],
link:components.html[components], etc. is registered. So we setup a
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] and the spring XML files looks
like:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:camel="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
         http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd
         http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd">

    <bean id="incidentservice" class="org.apache.camel.example.axis.ReportIncidentService"/>

    <camel:camelContext id="camel">
        <!-- TODO: Here we can add Camel stuff -->
    </camel:camelContext>

</beans>
----

[[BookTutorials-Storeafilebackup]]
Store a file backup
+++++++++++++++++++

We want to store the web service request as a file before we return a
response. To do this we want to send the file content as a
link:message.html[message] to an link:endpoint.html[endpoint] that
produces the link:file2.html[file]. So we need to do two steps:

* configure the file backup endpoint
* send the message to the endpoint

The endpoint is configured in spring XML so we just add it as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <camel:camelContext id="camelContext">
        <!-- endpoint named backup that is configued as a file component -->
        <camel:endpoint id="backup" uri="file://target?append=false"/>
    </camel:camelContext>
----

In the link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] we have defined our endpoint
with the id `backup` and configured it use the
link:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.html[URL notation] that we know from
the internet. Its a `file` scheme that accepts a context and some
options. The contest is `target` and its the folder to store the file.
The option is just as the internet with ? and & for subsequent options.
We configure it to not append, meaning than any existing file will be
overwritten. See the link:file2.html[File] component for options and how
to use the camel file endpoint.

Next up is to be able to send a message to this endpoint. The easiest
way is to use a ProducerTemplate. A ProducerTemplate is inspired by
Spring template pattern with for instance JmsTemplate or JdbcTemplate in
mind. The template that all the grunt work and exposes a simple
interface to the end-user where he/she can set the payload to send. Then
the template will do proper resource handling and all related issues in
that regard. But how do we get hold of such a template? Well the
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] is able to provide one. This is
done by configuring the template on the camel context in the spring XML
as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <camel:camelContext id="camelContext">
        <!-- producer template exposed with this id -->
        <camel:template id="camelTemplate"/>

        <!-- endpoint named backup that is configued as a file component -->
        <camel:endpoint id="backup" uri="file://target?append=false"/>
    </camel:camelContext>
----

Then we can expose a ProducerTemplate property on our service with a
setter in the Java code as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public class ReportIncidentService {

    private ProducerTemplate template;

    public void setTemplate(ProducerTemplate template) {
        this.template = template;
    }
----

And then let Spring handle the dependency inject as below:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <bean id="incidentservice" class="org.apache.camel.example.axis.ReportIncidentService">
        <!-- set the producer template to use from the camel context below -->
        <property name="template" ref="camelTemplate"/>
    </bean>
----

Now we are ready to use the producer template in our service to send the
payload to the endpoint. The template has many *sendXXX* methods for
this purpose. But before we send the payload to the file endpoint we
must also specify what filename to store the file as. This is done by
sending meta data with the payload. In Camel metadata is sent as
headers. Headers is just a plain `Map<String, Object>`. So if we needed
to send several metadata then we could construct an ordinary HashMap and
put the values in there. But as we just need to send one header with the
filename Camel has a convenient send method `sendBodyAndHeader` so we
choose this one.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public OutputReportIncident reportIncident(InputReportIncident parameters) {
        System.out.println("Hello ReportIncidentService is called from " + parameters.getGivenName());

        String data = parameters.getDetails();

        // store the data as a file
        String filename = parameters.getIncidentId() + ".txt";
        // send the data to the endpoint and the header contains what filename it should be stored as
        template.sendBodyAndHeader("backup", data, "org.apache.camel.file.name", filename);

        OutputReportIncident out = new OutputReportIncident();
        out.setCode("OK");
        return out;
    }
----

The template in the code above uses 4 parameters:

* the endpoint name, in this case the id referring to the endpoint
defined in Spring XML in the camelContext element.
* the payload, can be any kind of object
* the key for the header, in this case a Camel keyword to set the
filename
* and the value for the header

[[BookTutorials-Runningtheexample]]
Running the example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We start our integration with maven using `mvn jetty:run`. Then we open
a browser and hit `http://localhost:8080`. Jetty is so smart that it
display a frontpage with links to the deployed application so just hit
the link and you get our application. Now we hit append /services to the
URL to access the Axis frontpage. The URL should be
`http://localhost:8080/camel-example-axis/services`.

You can then test it using a web service test tools such as
http://www.soapui.org/[SoapUI]. +
Hitting the service will output to the console

And there should be a file in the target subfolder.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----

----

[[BookTutorials-UnitTesting]]
Unit Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We would like to be able to unit test our *ReportIncidentService* class.
So we add junit to the maven dependency:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>3.8.2</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
----

And then we create a plain junit testcase for our service class.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
package org.apache.camel.example.axis;

import junit.framework.TestCase;
import org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.InputReportIncident;
import org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.OutputReportIncident;

/**
 * Unit test of service
 */
public class ReportIncidentServiceTest extends TestCase {

    public void testIncident() {
        ReportIncidentService service = new ReportIncidentService();

        InputReportIncident input = createDummyIncident();
        OutputReportIncident output = service.reportIncident(input);
        assertEquals("OK", output.getCode());
    }

   protected InputReportIncident createDummyIncident() {
        InputReportIncident input = new InputReportIncident();
        input.setEmail("davsclaus@apache.org");
        input.setIncidentId("12345678");
        input.setIncidentDate("2008-07-13");
        input.setPhone("+45 2962 7576");
        input.setSummary("Failed operation");
        input.setDetails("The wrong foot was operated.");
        input.setFamilyName("Ibsen");
        input.setGivenName("Claus");
        return input;
    }

}
----

Then we can run the test with maven using: `mvn test`. But we will get a
failure:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]

template) to send a message to the file endpoint so the message will be
stored in a file. What we need is to get hold of such a producer and
inject it on our service, by calling the setter.

Since Camel is very light weight and embedable we are able to create a
CamelContext and add the endpoint in our unit test code directly. We do
this to show how this is possible:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    private CamelContext context;

    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        super.setUp();
        // CamelContext is just created like this
        context = new DefaultCamelContext();

        // then we can create our endpoint and set the options
        FileEndpoint endpoint = new FileEndpoint();
        // the endpoint must have the camel context set also
        endpoint.setCamelContext(context);
        // our output folder
        endpoint.setFile(new File("target"));
        // and the option not to append
        endpoint.setAppend(false);

        // then we add the endpoint just in java code just as the spring XML, we register it with the "backup" id.
        context.addSingletonEndpoint("backup", endpoint);

        // finally we need to start the context so Camel is ready to rock
        context.start();
    }

    @Override
    protected void tearDown() throws Exception {
        super.tearDown();
        // and we are nice boys so we stop it to allow resources to clean up
        context.stop();
    }
----

So now we are ready to set the ProducerTemplate on our service, and we
get a hold of that baby from the CamelContext as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void testIncident() {
        ReportIncidentService service = new ReportIncidentService();

        // get a producer template from the camel context
        ProducerTemplate template = context.createProducerTemplate();
        // inject it on our service using the setter
        service.setTemplate(template);

        InputReportIncident input = createDummyIncident();
        OutputReportIncident output = service.reportIncident(input);
        assertEquals("OK", output.getCode());
    }
----

And this time when we run the unit test its a success:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
Results :

Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
----

We would like to test that the file exists so we add these two lines to
our test method:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // should generate a file also
        File file = new File("target/" + input.getIncidentId() + ".txt");
        assertTrue("File should exists", file.exists());
----

[[BookTutorials-SmarterUnitTestingwithSpring]]
Smarter Unit Testing with Spring
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The unit test above requires us to assemble the Camel pieces manually in
java code. What if we would like our unit test to use our spring
configuration file *axis-example-context.xml* where we already have
setup the endpoint. And of course we would like to test using this
configuration file as this is the real file we will use. Well hey presto
the xml file is a spring ApplicationContext file and spring is able to
load it, so we go the spring path for unit testing. First we add the
spring-test jar to our maven dependency:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-test</artifactId>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
----

And then we refactor our unit test to be a standard spring unit class.
What we need to do is to extend `AbstractJUnit38SpringContextTests`
instead of `TestCase` in our unit test. Since Spring 2.5 embraces
annotations we will use one as well to instruct what our xml
configuration file is located:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
@ContextConfiguration(locations = "classpath:axis-example-context.xml")
public class ReportIncidentServiceTest extends AbstractJUnit38SpringContextTests {
----

What we must remember to add is the *classpath:* prefix as our xml file
is located in `src/main/resources`. If we omit the prefix then Spring
will by default try to locate the xml file in the current package and
that is org.apache.camel.example.axis. If the xml file is located
outside the classpath you can use file: prefix instead. So with these
two modifications we can get rid of all the setup and teardown code we
had before and now we will test our real configuration.

The last change is to get hold of the producer template and now we can
just refer to the bean id it has in the spring xml file:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <!-- producer template exposed with this id -->
        <camel:template id="camelTemplate"/>
----

So we get hold of it by just getting it from the spring
ApplicationContext as all spring users is used to do:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // get a producer template from the the spring context
        ProducerTemplate template = (ProducerTemplate) applicationContext.getBean("camelTemplate");
        // inject it on our service using the setter
        service.setTemplate(template);
----

Now our unit test is much better, and a real power of Camel is that is
fits nicely with Spring and you can use standard Spring'ish unit test to
test your Camel applications as well.

[[BookTutorials-UnitTestcallingWebService]]
Unit Test calling WebService
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What if you would like to execute a unit test where you send a
webservice request to the *AxisReportIncidentService* how do we unit
test this one? Well first of all the code is merely just a delegate to
our real service that we have just tested, but nevertheless its a good
question and we would like to know how. Well the answer is that we can
exploit that fact that Jetty is also a slim web container that can be
embedded anywhere just as Camel can. So we add this to our pom.xml:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.mortbay.jetty</groupId>
            <artifactId>jetty</artifactId>
            <version>${jetty-version}</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
----

Then we can create a new class *AxisReportIncidentServiceTest* to unit
test with Jetty. The code to setup Jetty is shown below with code
comments:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public class AxisReportIncidentServiceTest extends TestCase {

    private Server server;

    private void startJetty() throws Exception {
        // create an embedded Jetty server
        server = new Server();

        // add a listener on port 8080 on localhost (127.0.0.1)
        Connector connector = new SelectChannelConnector();
        connector.setPort(8080);
        connector.setHost("127.0.0.1");
        server.addConnector(connector);

        // add our web context path
        WebAppContext wac = new WebAppContext();
        wac.setContextPath("/unittest");
        // set the location of the exploded webapp where WEB-INF is located
        // this is a nice feature of Jetty where we can point to src/main/webapp
        wac.setWar("./src/main/webapp");
        server.setHandler(wac);

        // then start Jetty
        server.setStopAtShutdown(true);
        server.start();
    }

    @Override
    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        super.setUp();
        startJetty();
    }

    @Override
    protected void tearDown() throws Exception {
        super.tearDown();
        server.stop();
    }

}
----

Now we just need to send the incident as a webservice request using
Axis. So we add the following code:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    public void testReportIncidentWithAxis() throws Exception {
        // the url to the axis webservice exposed by jetty
        URL url = new URL("http://localhost:8080/unittest/services/ReportIncidentPort");

        // Axis stuff to get the port where we can send the webservice request
        ReportIncidentService_ServiceLocator locator = new ReportIncidentService_ServiceLocator();
        ReportIncidentService_PortType port = locator.getReportIncidentPort(url);

        // create input to send
        InputReportIncident input = createDummyIncident();
        // send the webservice and get the response
        OutputReportIncident output = port.reportIncident(input);
        assertEquals("OK", output.getCode());

        // should generate a file also
        File file = new File("target/" + input.getIncidentId() + ".txt");
        assertTrue("File should exists", file.exists());
    }

    protected InputReportIncident createDummyIncident() {
        InputReportIncident input = new InputReportIncident();
        input.setEmail("davsclaus@apache.org");
        input.setIncidentId("12345678");
        input.setIncidentDate("2008-07-13");
        input.setPhone("+45 2962 7576");
        input.setSummary("Failed operation");
        input.setDetails("The wrong foot was operated.");
        input.setFamilyName("Ibsen");
        input.setGivenName("Claus");
        return input;
    }
----

And now we have an unittest that sends a webservice request using good
old Axis.

[[BookTutorials-Annotations]]
Annotations
^^^^^^^^^^^

Both Camel and Spring has annotations that can be used to configure and
wire trivial settings more elegantly. Camel has the endpoint annotation
`@EndpointInjected` that is just what we need. With this annotation we
can inject the endpoint into our service. The annotation takes either a
name or uri parameter. The name is the bean id in the
link:registry.html[Registry]. The uri is the URI configuration for the
endpoint. Using this you can actually inject an endpoint that you have
not defined in the camel context. As we have defined our endpoint with
the id *backup* we use the name parameter.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    @EndpointInject(name = "backup")
    private ProducerTemplate template;
----

Camel is smart as `@EndpointInjected` supports different kinds of object
types. We like the ProducerTemplate so we just keep it as it is. +
Since we use annotations on the field directly we do not need to set the
property in the spring xml file so we change our service bean:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <bean id="incidentservice" class="org.apache.camel.example.axis.ReportIncidentService"/>
----

Running the unit test with `mvn test` reveals that it works nicely.

And since we use the `@EndpointInjected` that refers to the endpoint
with the id backup directly we can loose the template tag in the xml, so
its shorter:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <bean id="incidentservice" class="org.apache.camel.example.axis.ReportIncidentService"/>

    <camel:camelContext id="camelContext">
        <!-- producer template exposed with this id -->
        <camel:template id="camelTemplate"/>

        <!-- endpoint named backup that is configued as a file component -->
        <camel:endpoint id="backup" uri="file://target?append=false"/>

    </camel:camelContext>
----

And the final touch we can do is that since the endpoint is injected
with concrete endpoint to use we can remove the `"backup"` name
parameter when we send the message. So we change from:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // send the data to the endpoint and the header contains what filename it should be stored as
        template.sendBodyAndHeader("backup", data, "org.apache.camel.file.name", filename);
----

To without the name:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
        // send the data to the endpoint and the header contains what filename it should be stored as
        template.sendBodyAndHeader(data, "org.apache.camel.file.name", filename);
----

Then we avoid to duplicate the name and if we rename the endpoint name
then we don't forget to change it in the code also.

[[BookTutorials-TheEnd]]
The End
^^^^^^^

This tutorial hasn't really touched the one of the key concept of Camel
as a powerful routing and mediation framework. But we wanted to
demonstrate its flexibility and that it integrates well with even older
frameworks such as Apache Axis 1.4.

Check out the other tutorials on Camel and the other examples.

Note that the code shown here also applies to Camel 1.4 so actually you
can get started right away with the released version of Camel. As this
time of writing Camel 1.5 is work in progress.

[[BookTutorials-TutorialonusingCamelinaWebApplication]]
Tutorial on using Camel in a Web Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Camel has been designed to work great with the link:spring.html[Spring]
framework; so if you are already a Spring user you can think of Camel as
just a framework for adding to your Spring XML files.

So you can follow the usual Spring approach to working with web
applications; namely to add the standard Spring hook to load a
*/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml* file. In that file you can include
your usual Camel XML configuration.

[[BookTutorials-Step1:Edityourweb.xml]]
Step1: Edit your web.xml
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable spring add a context loader listener to your
*/WEB-INF/web.xml* file

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd"
         version="2.5">

  <listener>
    <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
  </listener>

</web-app>
----

This will cause Spring to boot up and look for the
*/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml* file.

[[BookTutorials-Step2:Createa/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xmlfile]]
Step 2: Create a /WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now you just need to create your Spring XML file and add your camel
routes or configuration.

For example

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans 
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/context 
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-2.5.xsd
       http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring 
       http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd">

  <camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
      <from uri="seda:foo"/>
      <to uri="mock:results"/>
    </route>
  </camelContext>

</beans>
----

Then boot up your web application and you're good to go!

[[BookTutorials-HintsandTips]]
Hints and Tips
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] to build your application
your directory tree will look like this...

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
src/main/webapp/WEB-INF
  web.xml
  applicationContext.xml
----

You should update your Maven pom.xml to enable WAR packaging/naming like
this...

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<project>
    ...
    <packaging>war</packaging>
    ...
    <build>
    <finalName>[desired WAR file name]</finalName>
        ...
    </build>
----

To enable more rapid development we highly recommend the
http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Maven+Jetty+Plugin[jetty:run
maven plugin].

Please refer to the
http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Maven+Jetty+Plugin[help for more
information on using jetty:run] - but briefly if you add the following
to your pom.xml

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.mortbay.jetty</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jetty-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
          <webAppConfig>
            <contextPath>/</contextPath>
          </webAppConfig>
          <scanIntervalSeconds>10</scanIntervalSeconds>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
----

Then you can run your web application as follows

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn jetty:run
----

Then Jetty will also monitor your target/classes directory and your
src/main/webapp directory so that if you modify your spring XML, your
web.xml or your java code the web application will be restarted,
re-creating your Camel routes.

If your unit tests take a while to run, you could miss them out when
running your web application via

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn -Dtest=false jetty:run

This tutorial is a work in progress.

[[BookTutorials-BackgroundandIntroduction]]
Background and Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[BookTutorials-BusinessBackground]]
Business Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So there's a company, which we'll call Acme. Acme sells widgets, in a
fairly unusual way. Their customers are responsible for telling Acme
what they purchased. The customer enters into their own systems (ERP or
whatever) which widgets they bought from Acme. Then at some point, their
systems emit a record of the sale which needs to go to Acme so Acme can
bill them for it. Obviously, everyone wants this to be as automated as
possible, so there needs to be integration between the customer's system
and Acme.

Sadly, Acme's sales people are, technically speaking, doormats. They
tell all their prospects, "you can send us the data in whatever format,
using whatever protocols, whatever. You just can't change once it's up
and running."

The result is pretty much what you'd expect. Taking a random sample of 3
customers:

* Customer 1: *XML over FTP*
* Customer 2: *CSV over HTTP*
* Customer 3: *Excel via e-mail*

Now on the Acme side, all this has to be converted to a canonical XML
format and submitted to the Acme accounting system via JMS. Then the
Acme accounting system does its stuff and sends an XML reply via JMS,
with a summary of what it processed (e.g. 3 line items accepted, line
item #2 in error, total invoice $123.45). Finally, that data needs to be
formatted into an e-mail, and sent to a contact at the customer in
question ("Dear Joyce, we received an invoice on 1/2/08. We accepted 3
line items totaling $123.45, though there was an error with line items
#2 [invalid quantity ordered]. Thank you for your business. Love,
Acme.").

So it turns out Camel can handle all this:

* Listen for HTTP, e-mail, and FTP files
* Grab attachments from the e-mail messages
* Convert XML, XLS, and CSV files to a canonical XML format
* read and write JMS messages
* route based on company ID
* format e-mails using Velocity templates
* send outgoing e-mail messages

[[BookTutorials-TutorialBackground]]
Tutorial Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tutorial will cover all that, plus setting up tests along the way.

Before starting, you should be familiar with:

* Camel concepts including the link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext],
link:routes.html[Routes], link:components.html[Components and
Endpoints], and link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise
Integration Patterns]
* Configuring Camel with the link:spring.html[XML] or link:dsl.html[Java
DSL]

You'll learn:

* How to set up a Maven build for a Camel project
* How to transform XML, CSV, and Excel data into a standard XML format
with Camel
** How to write POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), Velocity templates, and
XSLT stylesheets that are invoked by Camel routes for message
transformation
* How to configure simple and complex Routes in Camel, using either the
XML or the Java DSL format
* How to set up unit tests that load a Camel configuration and test
Camel routes
* How to use Camel's Data Formats to automatically convert data between
Java objects and XML, CSV files, etc.
* How to send and receive e-mail from Camel
* How to send and receive JMS messages from Camel
* How to use Enterprise Integration Patterns including Message Router
and Pipes and Filters
** How to use various languages to express content-based routing rules
in Camel
* How to deal with Camel messages, headers, and attachments

You may choose to treat this as a hands-on tutorial, and work through
building the code and configuration files yourself. Each of the sections
gives detailed descriptions of the steps that need to be taken to get
the components and routes working in Camel, and takes you through tests
to make sure they are working as expected.

But each section also links to working copies of the source and
configuration files, so if you don't want the hands-on approach, you can
simply review and/or download the finished files.

[[BookTutorials-High-LevelDiagram]]

Here's more or less what the integration process looks like.

[[BookTutorials-TutorialTasks]]
Tutorial Tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get through this scenario, we're going to break it down into smaller
pieces, implement and test those, and then try to assemble the big
scenario and test that.

Here's what we'll try to accomplish:

1.  Create a Maven build for the project
2.  Get sample files for the customer Excel, CSV, and XML input
3.  Get a sample file for the canonical XML format that Acme's
accounting system uses
4.  Create an XSD for the canonical XML format
5.  Create JAXB POJOs corresponding to the canonical XSD
6.  Create an XSLT stylesheet to convert the Customer 1 (XML over FTP)
messages to the canonical format
7.  Create a unit test to ensure that a simple Camel route invoking the
XSLT stylesheet works
8.  Create a POJO that converts a `List<List<String>>` to the above JAXB
POJOs
* Note that Camel can automatically convert CSV input to a List of Lists
of Strings representing the rows and columns of the CSV, so we'll use
this POJO to handle Customer 2 (CSV over HTTP)
9.  Create a unit test to ensure that a simple Camel route invoking the
CSV processing works
10. Create a POJO that converts a Customer 3 Excel file to the above
JAXB POJOs (using POI to read Excel)
11. Create a unit test to ensure that a simple Camel route invoking the
Excel processing works
12. Create a POJO that reads an input message, takes an attachment off
the message, and replaces the body of the message with the attachment
* This is assuming for Customer 3 (Excel over e-mail) that the e-mail
contains a single Excel file as an attachment, and the actual e-mail
body is throwaway
13. Build a set of Camel routes to handle the entire input (Customer ->
Acme) side of the scenario.
14. Build unit tests for the Camel input.
15. *TODO:* Tasks for the output (Acme -> Customer) side of the scenario

Step 1: Initial Maven build

We'll use Maven for this project as there will eventually be quite a few
dependencies and it's nice to have Maven handle them for us. You should
have a current version of Maven (e.g. 2.0.9) installed.

You can start with a pretty empty project directory and a Maven POM
file, or use a simple JAR archetype to create one.

Here's a sample POM. We've added a dependency on *camel-core*, and set
the compile version to 1.5 (so we can use annotations):

If you look at these files, you'll see that the different input formats
use different field names and/or ordering, because of course the sales
guys were totally OK with that. Sigh.

[[BookTutorials-Step3:XSDandJAXBBeansfortheCanonicalXMLFormat]]
Step 3: XSD and JAXB Beans for the Canonical XML Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here's the sample of the canonical XML file:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<invoice xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/tutorial/partners/invoice">
  <partner-id>2</partner-id>
  <date-received>9/12/2008</date-received>
  <line-item>
    <product-id>134</product-id>
    <description>A widget</description>
    <quantity>3</quantity>
    <item-price>10.45</item-price>
    <order-date>6/5/2008</order-date>
  </line-item>
  <!-- // more line-item elements here -->
  <order-total>218.82</order-total>
</invoice>
----

If you're ambitions, you can write your own XSD (XML Schema) for files
that look like this, and save it to `src/main/xsd`.

*Solution:* If not, you can
link:book-tutorials.data/canonical-acme-request.xsd?version=1&modificationDate=1221555594000&api=v2[download
mine], and save that to save it to `src/main/xsd`.

[[BookTutorials-GeneratingJAXBBeans]]
Generating JAXB Beans
+++++++++++++++++++++

Down the road we'll want to deal with the XML as Java POJOs. We'll take
a moment now to set up those XML binding POJOs. So we'll update the
Maven POM to generate JAXB beans from the XSD file.

We need a dependency:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<dependency>
    <artifactId>camel-jaxb</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
----

And a plugin configured:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxb2-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>xjc</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

That should do it (it automatically looks for XML Schemas in
`src/main/xsd` to generate beans for). Run *mvn install* and it should
emit the beans into `target/generated-sources/jaxb`. Your IDE should see
them there, though you may need to update the project to reflect the new
settings in the Maven POM.

[[BookTutorials-Step4:InitialWorkonCustomer1Input(XMLoverFTP)]]
Step 4: Initial Work on Customer 1 Input (XML over FTP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get a start on Customer 1, we'll create an XSLT template to convert
the Customer 1 sample file into the canonical XML format, write a small
Camel route to test it, and build that into a unit test. If we get
through this, we can be pretty sure that the XSLT template is valid and
can be run safely in Camel.

[[BookTutorials-CreateanXSLTtemplate]]
Create an XSLT template
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Start with the
link:book-tutorials.data/input-customer1.xml?version=1&modificationDate=1221304897000&api=v2[Customer
1 sample input]. You want to create an XSLT template to generate XML
like the canonical XML sample above â an `invoice` element with
`line-item` elements (one per item in the original XML document). If
you're especially clever, you can populate the current date and order
total elements too.

*Solution:* My
link:book-tutorials.data/XMLConverter.xsl?version=1&modificationDate=1221315500000&api=v2[sample
XSLT template] isn't that smart, but it'll get you going if you don't
want to write one of your own.

[[BookTutorials-Createaunittest]]
Create a unit test
++++++++++++++++++

Here's where we get to some meaty Camel work. We need to:

* Set up a unit test
* That loads a Camel configuration
* That has a route invoking our XSLT
* Where the test sends a message to the route
* And ensures that some XML comes out the end of the route

The easiest way to do this is to set up a Spring context that defines
the Camel stuff, and then use a base unit test class from Spring that
knows how to load a Spring context to run tests against. So, the
procedure is:

[[BookTutorials-SetUpaSkeletalCamel/SpringUnitTest]]
Set Up a Skeletal Camel/Spring Unit Test

1.  Add dependencies on Camel-Spring, and the Spring test JAR (which
will automatically bring in JUnit 3.8.x) to your POM:
+
[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<dependency>
    <artifactId>camel-spring</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <artifactId>spring-test</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <version>2.5.5</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
2.  Create a new unit test class in `src/test/java/your-package-here`,
perhaps called `XMLInputTest.java`
3.  Make the test extend Spring's
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/test/context/junit38/AbstractJUnit38SpringContextTests.html[AbstractJUnit38SpringContextTests]
class, so it can load a Spring context for the test
4.  Create a Spring context configuration file in `src/test/resources`,
perhaps called `XMLInputTest-context.xml`
5.  In the unit test class, use the class-level
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/test/context/ContextConfiguration.html[@ContextConfiguration]
annotation to indicate that a Spring context should be loaded
* By default, this looks for a Context configuration file called
`TestClassName-context.xml` in a subdirectory corresponding to the
package of the test class. For instance, if your test class was
`org.apache.camel.tutorial.XMLInputTest`, it would look for
`org/apache/camel/tutorial/XMLInputTest-context.xml`
* To override this default, use the *locations* attribute on the
@ContextConfiguration annotation to provide specific context file
locations (starting each path with a / if you don't want it to be
relative to the package directory). My solution does this so I can put
the context file directly in `src/test/resources` instead of in a
package directory under there.
6.  Add a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/CamelContext.html[CamelContext]
instance variable to the test class, with the
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Autowired.html[@Autowired]
annotation. That way Spring will automatically pull the CamelContext out
of the Spring context and inject it into our test class.
7.  Add a
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/ProducerTemplate.html[ProducerTemplate]
instance variable and a `setUp` method that instantiates it from the
CamelContext. We'll use the ProducerTemplate later to send messages to
the route.
+
[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
protected ProducerTemplate<Exchange> template;

protected void setUp() throws Exception {
    super.setUp();
    template = camelContext.createProducerTemplate();
}
----
8.  Put in an empty test method just for the moment (so when we run this
we can see that "1 test succeeded")
9.  Add the Spring
http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/beans.html#beans-factory-metadata[<beans>]
element (including the
http://activemq.apache.org/camel/xml-reference.html[Camel Namespace])
with an empty link:spring.html[<camelContext>] element to the Spring
context, like this:
+
[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                               http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd
                           http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring
                               http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring/camel-spring-1.4.0.xsd">

    <camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
    </camelContext>
</beans>
----

Test it by running *mvn install* and make sure there are no build
errors. So far it doesn't test much; just that your project and test and
source files are all organized correctly, and the one empty test method
completes successfully.

*Solution:* Your test class might look something like this:

* src/test/java/org/apache/camel/tutorial/link:book-tutorials.data/empty-XMLInputTest.java?version=3&modificationDate=1221634419000&api=v2[XMLInputTest.java]
* src/test/resources/XMLInputTest-context.xml (same as just above)

[[BookTutorials-FleshOuttheUnitTest]]
Flesh Out the Unit Test

So now we're going to write a Camel route that applies the XSLT to the
sample Customer 1 input file, and makes sure that some XML output comes
out:

1.  Save the
link:book-tutorials.data/input-customer1.xml?version=1&modificationDate=1221304897000&api=v2[input-customer1.xml]
file to `src/test/resources`
2.  Save your XSLT file (created in the previous step) to
`src/main/resources`
3.  Write a Camel Route, either right in the Spring XML, or using the
Java DSL (in another class under `src/test/java` somewhere). This route
should use the link:pipes-and-filters.html[Pipes and Filters]
integration pattern to:
1.  Start from the endpoint link:direct.html[direct:start] (which lets
the test conveniently pass messages into the route)
2.  Call the endpoint link:xslt.html[xslt:YourXSLTFile.xsl] (to
transform the message with the specified XSLT template)
3.  Send the result to the endpoint link:mock.html[mock:finish] (which
lets the test verify the route output)
4.  Add a test method to the unit test class that:
1.  Get a reference to the Mock endpoint `mock:finish` using code like
this:
+
[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
MockEndpoint finish = MockEndpoint.resolve(camelContext, "mock:finish");
----
2.  Set the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/component/mock/MockEndpoint.html#setExpectedMessageCount(int)[expectedMessageCount]
on that endpoint to 1
3.  Get a reference to the Customer 1 input file, using code like this:
+
[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
InputStream in = XMLInputTest.class.getResourceAsStream("/input-partner1.xml");
assertNotNull(in);
----
4.  Send that InputStream as a message to the `direct:start` endpoint,
using code like this:
+
[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    template.sendBody("direct:start", in);
----
+
Note that we can send the sample file body in several formats (File,
InputStream, String, etc.) but in this case an InputStream is pretty
convenient.
5.  Ensure that the message made it through the route to the final
endpoint, by testing all configured Mock endpoints
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/component/mock/MockEndpoint.html#assertIsSatisfied(org.apache.camel.CamelContext)[like
this]:
+
[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
MockEndpoint.assertIsSatisfied(camelContext);
----
6.  If you like, inspect the final message body using some code like
`finish.getExchanges().get(0).getIn().getBody()`.
* If you do this, you'll need to know what format that body is â String,
byte array, InputStream, etc.
5.  Run your test with *mvn install* and make sure the build completes
successfully.

*Solution:* Your finished test might look something like this:

* src/test/java/org/apache/camel/tutorial/link:book-tutorials.data/XMLInputTest.java?version=3&modificationDate=1221637330000&api=v2[XMLInputTest.java]
* For XML Configuration:
** src/test/resources/link:book-tutorials.data/XMLInputTest-context.xml?version=1&modificationDate=1221560232000&api=v2[XMLInputTest-context.xml]
* Or, for Java DSL Configuration:
** src/test/resources/link:book-tutorials.data/XMLInputTest-dsl-context.xml?version=1&modificationDate=1221627131000&api=v2[XMLInputTest-dsl-context.xml]
** src/test/java/org/apache/camel/tutorial/routes/link:book-tutorials.data/XMLInputTestRoute.java?version=1&modificationDate=1221627131000&api=v2[XMLInputTestRoute.java]

**Test Base Class**

Once your test class is working, you might want to extract things like
the @Autowired CamelContext, the ProducerTemplate, and the setUp method
to a custom base class that you extend with your other tests.

[[BookTutorials-Step5:InitialWorkonCustomer2Input(CSVoverHTTP)]]
Step 5: Initial Work on Customer 2 Input (CSV over HTTP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get a start on Customer 2, we'll create a POJO to convert the
Customer 2 sample CSV data into the JAXB POJOs representing the
canonical XML format, write a small Camel route to test it, and build
that into a unit test. If we get through this, we can be pretty sure
that the CSV conversion and JAXB handling is valid and can be run safely
in Camel.

[[BookTutorials-CreateaCSV-handlingPOJO]]
Create a CSV-handling POJO
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To begin with, link:csv.html[CSV is a known data format] in Camel. Camel
can convert a CSV file to a List (representing rows in the CSV) of Lists
(representing cells in the row) of Strings (the data for each cell).
That means our POJO can just assume the data coming in is of type
`List<List<String>>`, and we can declare a method with that as the
argument.

Looking at the JAXB code in `target/generated-sources/jaxb`, it looks
like an `Invoice` object represents the whole document, with a nested
list of LineItemType objects for the line items. Therefore our POJO
method will return an `Invoice` (a document in the canonical XML
format).

So to implement the CSV-to-JAXB POJO, we need to do something like this:

1.  Create a new class under `src/main/java`, perhaps called
`CSVConverterBean`.
2.  Add a method, with one argument of type `List<List<String>>` and the
return type `Invoice`
* You may link:bean.html[annotate] the argument with
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Body.html[@Body]
to specifically designate it as the body of the incoming message
3.  In the method, the logic should look roughly like this:
1.  Create a new `Invoice`, using the method on the generated
`ObjectFactory` class
2.  Loop through all the rows in the incoming CSV (the outer `List`)
3.  Skip the first row, which contains headers (column names)
4.  For the other rows:
1.  Create a new `LineItemType` (using the `ObjectFactory` again)
2.  Pick out all the cell values (the Strings in the inner `List`) and
put them into the correct fields of the `LineItemType`
* Not all of the values will actually go into the line item in this
example
* You may hardcode the column ordering based on the sample data file, or
else try to read it dynamically from the headers in the first line
* Note that you'll need to use a JAXB `DatatypeFactory` to create the
`XMLGregorianCalendar` values that JAXB uses for the `date` fields in
the XML â which probably means using a `SimpleDateFormat` to parse the
date and setting that date on a `GregorianCalendar`
3.  Add the line item to the invoice
5.  Populate the partner ID, date of receipt, and order total on the
`Invoice`
6.  Throw any exceptions out of the method, so Camel knows something
went wrong
7.  Return the finished `Invoice`

*Solution:* Here's an example of what the
link:book-tutorials.data/CSVConverterBean.java?version=1&modificationDate=1221634021000&api=v2[CSVConverterBean]
might look like.

[[BookTutorials-Createaunittest.1]]
Create a unit test
++++++++++++++++++

Start with a simple test class and test Spring context like last time,
perhaps based on the name `CSVInputTest`:

*CSVInputTest.java*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
/**
 * A test class the ensure we can convert Partner 2 CSV input files to the
 * canonical XML output format, using JAXB POJOs.
 */
@ContextConfiguration(locations = "/CSVInputTest-context.xml")
public class CSVInputTest extends AbstractJUnit38SpringContextTests {
    @Autowired
    protected CamelContext camelContext;
    protected ProducerTemplate<Exchange> template;

    protected void setUp() throws Exception {
        super.setUp();
        template = camelContext.createProducerTemplate();
    }

    public void testCSVConversion() {
        // TODO
    }
}
----

*CSVInputTest-context.xml*

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                               http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd
                           http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring
                               http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring/camel-spring-1.4.0.xsd">

    <camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/schema/spring">
        <!-- TODO -->
    </camelContext>
</beans>
----

Now the meaty part is to flesh out the test class and write the Camel
routes.

1.  Update the Maven POM to include link:csv.html[CSV]
link:data-format.html[Data Format] support:
+
[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<dependency>
    <artifactId>camel-csv</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <version>1.4.0</version>
</dependency>
----
2.  Write the routes (right in the Spring XML context, or using the Java
DSL) for the CSV conversion process, again using the
link:pipes-and-filters.html[Pipes and Filters] pattern:
1.  Start from the endpoint link:direct.html[direct:CSVstart] (which
lets the test conveniently pass messages into the route). We'll name
this differently than the starting point for the previous test, in case
you use the Java DSL and put all your routes in the same package (which
would mean that each test would load the DSL routes for several tests.)
2.  This time, there's a little preparation to be done. Camel doesn't
know that the initial input is a CSV, so it won't be able to convert it
to the expected `List<List<String>>` without a little hint. For that, we
need an link:data-format.html[unmarshal] transformation in the route.
The `unmarshal` method (in the DSL) or element (in the XML) takes a
child indicating the format to unmarshal; in this case that should be
`csv`.
3.  Next invoke the POJO to transform the message with a
link:bean.html[bean:CSVConverter] endpoint
4.  As before, send the result to the endpoint
link:mock.html[mock:finish] (which lets the test verify the route
output)
5.  Finally, we need a Spring `<bean>` element in the Spring context XML
file (but outside the `<camelContext>` element) to define the Spring
bean that our route invokes. This Spring bean should have a `name`
attribute that matches the name used in the `bean` endpoint
(`CSVConverter` in the example above), and a `class` attribute that
points to the CSV-to-JAXB POJO class you wrote above (such as,
`org.apache.camel.tutorial.CSVConverterBean`). When Spring is in the
picture, any `bean` endpoints look up Spring beans with the specified
name.
3.  Write a test method in the test class, which should look very
similar to the previous test class:
1.  Get the MockEndpoint for the final endpoint, and tell it to expect
one message
2.  Load the Partner 2 sample CSV file from the ClassPath, and send it
as the body of a message to the starting endpoint
3.  Verify that the final MockEndpoint is satisfied (that is, it
received one message) and examine the message body if you like
* Note that we didn't link:data-format.html[marshal] the JAXB POJOs to
XML in this test, so the final message should contain an `Invoice` as
the body. You could write a simple line of code to get the Exchange (and
Message) from the MockEndpoint to confirm that.
4.  Run this new test with *mvn install* and make sure it passes and the
build completes successfully.

*Solution:* Your finished test might look something like this:

* src/test/java/org/apache/camel/tutorial/link:book-tutorials.data/CSVInputTest.java?version=2&modificationDate=1221678956000&api=v2[CSVInputTest.java]
* For XML Configuration:
** src/test/resources/link:book-tutorials.data/CSVInputTest-context.xml?version=2&modificationDate=1221678956000&api=v2[CSVInputTest-context.xml]
* Or, for Java DSL Configuration:
** src/test/resources/link:book-tutorials.data/CSVInputTest-dsl-context.xml?version=1&modificationDate=1221678956000&api=v2[CSVInputTest-dsl-context.xml]

[[BookTutorials-Step6:InitialWorkonCustomer3Input(Excelovere-mail)]]
Step 6: Initial Work on Customer 3 Input (Excel over e-mail)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get a start on Customer 3, we'll create a POJO to convert the
Customer 3 sample Excel data into the JAXB POJOs representing the
canonical XML format, write a small Camel route to test it, and build
that into a unit test. If we get through this, we can be pretty sure
that the Excel conversion and JAXB handling is valid and can be run
safely in Camel.

[[BookTutorials-CreateanExcel-handlingPOJO]]
Create an Excel-handling POJO
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Camel does not have a data format handler for Excel by default. We have
two options â create an Excel
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/index.html[DataFormat]
(so Camel can convert Excel spreadsheets to something like the CSV
`List<List<String>>` automatically), or create a POJO that can translate
Excel data manually. For now, the second approach is easier (if we go
the `DataFormat` route, we need code to both read and write Excel files,
whereas otherwise read-only will do).

So, we need a POJO with a method that takes something like an
`InputStream` or `byte[]` as an argument, and returns in `Invoice` as
before. The process should look something like this:

1.  Update the Maven POM to include http://poi.apache.org/[POI] support:
+
[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<dependency>
    <artifactId>poi</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
    <version>3.1-FINAL</version>
</dependency>
----
2.  Create a new class under `src/main/java`, perhaps called
`ExcelConverterBean`.
3.  Add a method, with one argument of type `InputStream` and the return
type `Invoice`
* You may link:bean.html[annotate] the argument with
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Body.html[@Body]
to specifically designate it as the body of the incoming message
4.  In the method, the logic should look roughly like this:
1.  Create a new `Invoice`, using the method on the generated
`ObjectFactory` class
2.  Create a new
http://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/hssf/usermodel/HSSFWorkbook.html[HSSFWorkbook]
from the `InputStream`, and get the
http://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/hssf/usermodel/HSSFWorkbook.html#getSheetAt(int)[first
sheet] from it
3.  Loop through
http://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/hssf/usermodel/HSSFSheet.html#rowIterator()[all
the rows] in the sheet
4.  Skip the first row, which contains headers (column names)
5.  For the other rows:
1.  Create a new `LineItemType` (using the `ObjectFactory` again)
2.  Pick out
http://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/hssf/usermodel/HSSFRow.html#cellIterator()[all
the cell values] and put them into the correct fields of the
`LineItemType` (you'll need some data type conversion logic)
* Not all of the values will actually go into the line item in this
example
* You may hardcode the column ordering based on the sample data file, or
else try to read it dynamically from the headers in the first line
* Note that you'll need to use a JAXB `DatatypeFactory` to create the
`XMLGregorianCalendar` values that JAXB uses for the `date` fields in
the XML â which probably means setting the
http://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/hssf/usermodel/HSSFCell.html#getDateCellValue()[date
from a date cell] on a `GregorianCalendar`
3.  Add the line item to the invoice
6.  Populate the partner ID, date of receipt, and order total on the
`Invoice`
7.  Throw any exceptions out of the method, so Camel knows something
went wrong
8.  Return the finished `Invoice`

*Solution:* Here's an example of what the
link:book-tutorials.data/ExcelConverterBean.java?version=1&modificationDate=1221702252000&api=v2[ExcelConverterBean]
might look like.

[[BookTutorials-Createaunittest.2]]
Create a unit test
++++++++++++++++++

The unit tests should be pretty familiar now. The test class and context
for the Excel bean should be quite similar to the CSV bean.

1.  Create the basic test class and corresponding Spring Context XML
configuration file
2.  The XML config should look a lot like the CSV test, except:
* Remember to use a different start endpoint name if you're using the
Java DSL and not use separate packages per test
* You don't need the `unmarshal` step since the Excel POJO takes the raw
`InputStream` from the source endpoint
* You'll declare a `<bean>` and endpoint for the Excel bean prepared
above instead of the CSV bean
3.  The test class should look a lot like the CSV test, except use the
right input file name and start endpoint name.

**Logging**

You may notice that your tests emit a lot less output all of a sudden.
The dependency on POI brought in Log4J and configured commons-logging to
use it, so now we need a
link:book-tutorials.data/log4j.properties?version=1&modificationDate=1221732568000&api=v2[log4j.properties]
file to configure log output. You can use the attached one (snarfed from
ActiveMQ) or write your own; either way save it to `src/main/resources`
to ensure you continue to see log output.

*Solution:* Your finished test might look something like this:

* src/test/java/org/apache/camel/tutorial/link:book-tutorials.data/ExcelInputTest.java?version=1&modificationDate=1221732213000&api=v2[ExcelInputTest.java]
* For XML Configuration:
** src/test/resources/link:book-tutorials.data/ExcelInputTest-context.xml?version=1&modificationDate=1221732213000&api=v2[ExcelInputTest-context.xml]
* Or, for Java DSL Configuration:
** src/test/resources/link:book-tutorials.data/ExcelInputTest-dsl-context.xml?version=1&modificationDate=1221732432000&api=v2[ExcelInputTest-dsl-context.xml]
** src/test/java/org/apache/camel/tutorial/routes/link:book-tutorials.data/ExcelInputTestRoute.java?version=1&modificationDate=1221732432000&api=v2[ExcelInputTestRoute.java]

Step 7: Put this all together into Camel routes for the Customer Input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With all the data type conversions working, the next step is to write
the real routes that listen for HTTP, FTP, or e-mail input, and write
the final XML output to an ActiveMQ queue. Along the way these routes
will use the data conversions we've developed above.

So we'll create 3 routes to start with, as shown in the diagram back at
the beginning:

1.  Accept XML orders over FTP from Customer 1 (we'll assume the FTP
server dumps files in a local directory on the Camel machine)
2.  Accept CSV orders over HTTP from Customer 2
3.  Accept Excel orders via e-mail from Customer 3 (we'll assume the
messages are sent to an account we can access via IMAP)
