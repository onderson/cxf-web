Quickstart
----------

To start using Apache Camel quickly, you can read through some simple
examples in this chapter. For readers who would like a more thorough
introduction, please skip ahead to Chapter 3.

[[BookQuickstart-WalkthroughanExampleCode]]
Walk through an Example Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mini-guide takes you through the source code of a
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-jms-file/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/jmstofile/CamelJmsToFileExample.java[simple
example].

Camel can be configured either by using link:spring.html[Spring] or
directly in Java - which
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-jms-file/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/jmstofile/CamelJmsToFileExample.java[this
example does].

This example is available in the `examples\camel-example-jms-file`
directory of the link:download.html[Camel distribution].

We start with creating a link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] - which is
a container for link:components.html[Components],
link:routes.html[Routes]
etc:\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-jms-file/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/jmstofile/CamelJmsToFileExample.java}There
is more than one way of adding a Component to the CamelContext. You can
add components implicitly - when we set up the routing - as we do here
for the
link:file2.html[FileComponent]:\{snippet:id=e3|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-jms-file/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/jmstofile/CamelJmsToFileExample.java}or
explicitly - as we do here when we add the JMS
Component:\{snippet:id=e2|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-jms-file/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/jmstofile/CamelJmsToFileExample.java}The
above works with any JMS provider. If we know we are using
link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ] we can use an even simpler form using the
http://activemq.apache.org/maven/5.5.0/activemq-camel/apidocs/org/apache/activemq/camel/component/ActiveMQComponent.html#activeMQComponent%28java.lang.String%29[`activeMQComponent()`
method] while specifying the
http://activemq.apache.org/configuring-transports.html[brokerURL] used
to connect to ActiveMQ

In normal use, an external system would be firing messages or events
directly into Camel through one if its link:components.html[Components]
but we are going to use the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/ProducerTemplate.html[ProducerTemplate]
which is a really easy way for testing your
configuration:\{snippet:id=e4|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-jms-file/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/jmstofile/CamelJmsToFileExample.java}Next
you *must* start the camel context. If you are using
link:spring.html[Spring] to configure the camel context this is
automatically done for you; though if you are using a pure Java approach
then you just need to call the start() method

camelContext.start();

This will start all of the configured routing rules.

So after starting the link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext], we can fire
some objects into
camel:\{snippet:id=e5|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/examples/camel-example-jms-file/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/example/jmstofile/CamelJmsToFileExample.java}

[[BookQuickstart-Whathappens?]]
What happens?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the
http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/ProducerTemplate.html[ProducerTemplate]
- we send objects (in this case text) into the
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext] to the Component
_test-jms:queue:test.queue_. These text objects will be
link:type-converter.html[converted automatically] into JMS Messages and
posted to a JMS Queue named _test.queue_. When we set up the
link:routes.html[Route], we configured the
link:file2.html[FileComponent] to listen off the _test.queue_.

The File link:file2.html[FileComponent] will take messages off the
Queue, and save them to a directory named _test_. Every message will be
saved in a file that corresponds to its destination and message id.

Finally, we configured our own listener in the link:routes.html[Route] -
to take notifications from the link:file2.html[FileComponent] and print
them out as text.

*That's it!*

If you have the time then use 5 more minutes to
link:walk-through-another-example.html[Walk through another example]
that demonstrates the Spring DSL (XML based) routing.

[[BookQuickstart-Introduction]]
Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Continuing the walk from our first
link:walk-through-an-example.html[example], we take a closer look at the
routing and explain a few pointers - so you won't walk into a bear trap,
but can enjoy an after-hours walk to the local pub for a large beer
image:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/s/en_GB/5997/6f42626d00e36f53fe51440403446ca61552e2a2.1/_/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png[(wink)]

First we take a moment to look at the
link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[Enterprise Integration
Patterns] - the base pattern catalog for integration scenarios. In
particular we focus on link:pipes-and-filters.html[Pipes and filters] -
a central pattern. This is used to route messages through a sequence of
processing steps, each performing a specific function - much like the
Java Servlet Filters.

[[BookQuickstart-Pipesandfilters]]
Pipes and filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this sample we want to process a message in a sequence of steps where
each steps can perform their specific function. In our example we have a
link:jms.html[JMS] queue for receiving new orders. When an order is
received we need to process it in several steps:

* validate
* register
* send confirm email

This can be created in a route like this:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
   <from uri="jms:queue:order"/>
   <pipeline>
      <bean ref="validateOrder"/>
      <bean ref="registerOrder"/>
      <bean ref="sendConfirmEmail"/>
   </pipeline>
</route>
----

**Pipeline is default**

In the route above we specify `pipeline` but it can be omitted as its
default, so you can write the route as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
   <from uri="jms:queue:order"/>
   <bean ref="validateOrder"/>
   <bean ref="registerOrder"/>
   <bean ref="sendConfirmEmail"/>
</route>
----

This is commonly used not to state the pipeline.

An example where the pipeline needs to be used, is when using a
multicast and "one" of the endpoints to send to (as a logical group) is
a pipeline of other endpoints. For example.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
   <from uri="jms:queue:order"/>
   <multicast>
     <to uri="log:org.company.log.Category"/>
     <pipeline>
       <bean ref="validateOrder"/>
       <bean ref="registerOrder"/>
       <bean ref="sendConfirmEmail"/>
     </pipeline>
   </multicast>
</route>
----

The above sends the order (from `jms:queue:order`) to two locations at
the same time, our log component, and to the "pipeline" of beans which
goes one to the other. If you consider the opposite, sans the
`<pipeline>`

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
   <from uri="jms:queue:order"/>
   <multicast>
     <to uri="log:org.company.log.Category"/>
     <bean ref="validateOrder"/>
     <bean ref="registerOrder"/>
     <bean ref="sendConfirmEmail"/>
   </multicast>
</route>
----

you would see that multicast would not "flow" the message from one bean
to the next, but rather send the order to all 4 endpoints (1x log, 3x
bean) in parallel, which is not (for this example) what we want. We need
the message to flow to the validateOrder, then to the registerOrder,
then the sendConfirmEmail so adding the pipeline, provides this
facility.

Where as the `bean ref` is a reference for a spring bean id, so we
define our beans using regular Spring XML as:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
   <bean id="validateOrder" class="com.mycompany.MyOrderValidator"/>
----

Our validator bean is a plain POJO that has no dependencies to Camel
what so ever. So you can implement this POJO as you like. Camel uses
rather intelligent link:bean-binding.html[Bean Binding] to invoke your
POJO with the payload of the received message. In this example we will
*not* dig into this how this happens. You should return to this topic
later when you got some hands on experience with Camel how it can easily
bind routing using your existing POJO beans.

So what happens in the route above. Well when an order is received from
the link:jms.html[JMS] queue the message is routed like
link:pipes-and-filters.html[Pipes and filters]: +
1. payload from the link:jms.html[JMS] is sent as input to the
validateOrder bean +
2. the output from validateOrder bean is sent as input to the
registerOrder bean +
3. the output from registerOrder bean is sent as input to the
sendConfirmEmail bean

[[BookQuickstart-UsingCamelComponents]]
Using Camel Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the route lets imagine that the registration of the order has to be
done by sending data to a TCP socket that could be a big mainframe. As
Camel has many link:components.html[Components] we will use the
camel-mina component that supports link:mina.html[TCP] connectivity. So
we change the route to:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
   <from uri="jms:queue:order"/>
   <bean ref="validateOrder"/>
   <to uri="mina:tcp://mainframeip:4444?textline=true"/>
   <bean ref="sendConfirmEmail"/>
</route>
----

What we now have in the route is a `to` type that can be used as a
direct replacement for the bean type. The steps is now: +
1. payload from the link:jms.html[JMS] is sent as input to the
validateOrder bean +
2. the output from validateOrder bean is sent as text to the mainframe
using TCP +
3. the output from mainframe is sent back as input to the
sendConfirmEmai bean

What to notice here is that the `to` is not the end of the route (the
world
image:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/s/en_GB/5997/6f42626d00e36f53fe51440403446ca61552e2a2.1/_/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png[(wink)])
in this example it's used in the middle of the
link:pipes-and-filters.html[Pipes and filters]. In fact we can change
the `bean` types to `to` as well:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
   <from uri="jms:queue:order"/>
   <to uri="bean:validateOrder"/>
   <to uri="mina:tcp://mainframeip:4444?textline=true"/>
   <to uri="bean:sendConfirmEmail"/>
</route>
----

As the `to` is a generic type we must state in the uri scheme which
component it is. So we must write *bean:* for the link:bean.html[Bean]
component that we are using.

[[BookQuickstart-Conclusion]]
Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

This example was provided to demonstrate the Spring DSL (XML based) as
opposed to the pure Java DSL from the
link:walk-through-an-example.html[first example]. And as well to point
about that the `to` doesn't have to be the last node in a route graph.

This example is also based on the *in-only* message exchange pattern.
What you must understand as well is the *in-out* message exchange
pattern, where the caller expects a response. We will look into this in
another example.
