Delayer
^^^^^^^

The Delayer Pattern allows you to delay the delivery of messages to some
destination.

Delayer

The expression is a value in millis to wait from the current time, so
the expression should just be `3000`. +
However you can use a long value for a fixed value to indicate the delay
in millis. +
See the Spring DSL samples for Delayer.

|=======================================================================
|Name |Default Value |Description
|`asyncDelayed` |`false` |*Camel 2.4:* If enabled then delayed messages
happens asynchronously using a scheduled thread pool.

|`executorServiceRef` |Â  |*Camel 2.4:* Refers to a custom
link:threading-model.html[Thread Pool] to be used if `asyncDelay` has
been enabled.

|`callerRunsWhenRejected` |`true` |*Camel 2.4:* Is used if
`asyncDelayed` was enabled. This controls if the caller thread should
execute the task if the thread pool rejected the task.
|=======================================================================

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]*

The example below will delay all messages received on *seda:b* 1 second
before sending them to *http://mockresult[mock:result]*.

\{snippet:id=ex2|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/DelayerTest.java}

You can just delay things a fixed amount of time from the point at which
the delayer receives the message. For example to delay things 2 seconds

delayer(2000)

The above assume that the delivery order is maintained and that the
messages are delivered in delay order. If you want to reorder the
messages based on delivery time, you can use the
link:resequencer.html[Resequencer] with this pattern. For example

from("activemq:someQueue").resequencer(header("MyDeliveryTime")).delay("MyRedeliveryTime").to("activemq:aDelayedQueue");

You can of course use many different link:expression.html[Expression]
languages such as link:xpath.html[XPath], link:xquery.html[XQuery],
link:sql.html[SQL] or various link:scripting-languages.html[Scripting
Languages]. For example to delay the message for the time period
specified in the header, use the following syntax:

from("activemq:someQueue").delay(header("delayValue")).to("activemq:aDelayedQueue");

And to delay processing using the link:simple.html[Simple] language you
can use the following DSL:

from("activemq:someQueue").delay(simple("$\{body.delayProperty}")).to("activemq:aDelayedQueue");

[[Delayer-SpringDSL]]
Spring DSL
++++++++++

The sample below demonstrates the delay in Spring DSL:

\{snippet:id=example|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/delayer.xml}

For further examples of this pattern in use you could look at the
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/DelayerTest.java?view=markup[junit
test case]

[[Delayer-Asynchronousdelaying]]
Asynchronous delaying
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.4*

You can let the link:delayer.html[Delayer] use non blocking asynchronous
delaying, which means Camel will use a scheduler to schedule a task to
be executed in the future. The task will then continue routing. This
allows the caller thread to not block and be able to service other
messages etc.

[[Delayer-FromJavaDSL]]
From Java DSL
+++++++++++++

You use the `asyncDelayed()` to enable the async behavior.

from("activemq:queue:foo").delay(1000).asyncDelayed().to("activemq:aDelayedQueue");

[[Delayer-FromSpringXML]]
From Spring XML
+++++++++++++++

You use the `asyncDelayed="true"` attribute to enable the async
behavior.

xml<route> <from uri="activemq:queue:foo"/> <delay asyncDelayed="true">
<constant>1000</constant> </delay> <to uri="activemq:aDealyedQueue"/>
</route>

[[Delayer-Creatingacustomdelay]]
Creating a custom delay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use an expression to determine when to send a message using
something like this

from("activemq:foo"). delay().method("someBean", "computeDelay").
to("activemq:bar");

then the bean would look like this...

public class SomeBean \{ public long computeDelay() \{ long delay = 0;
// use java code to compute a delay value in millis return delay; } }
