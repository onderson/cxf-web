How to add a new component
--------------------------

[[AddNewComponentGuide-1.OpenanJIRAissue]]
1. Open an JIRA issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open a JIRA issue at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL, if
does not already exist. +
The issue type should be "New Feature". A sample can be found here:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-3468

[[AddNewComponentGuide-2.Checkthelicenseofalldependencies]]
2. Check the license of all dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have to check whether or not all required dependencies have an
Apache compatible license. +
Please refer to http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html[Third-Party
Licensing Policy] for detailed information and acceptable licenses (see
especially about excluded licenses). +
This *doesn't* mean, if one of the dependencies are not compatible with
the Apache license we can't accept the component. In this case, we might
have to add the component to the
http://code.google.com/p/camel-extra/[Camel-Extra] repository.

[[AddNewComponentGuide-3.Providingapatch]]
3. Providing a patch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to contribute a new component as a patch (we love
contributions), please refer to
http://camel.apache.org/contributing.html[Contributing] (look for
`Creating patches`) for instructions.

[[AddNewComponentGuide-4.Addthenewcomponent]]
4. Add the new component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the new component into the components pom modules section (note the
alphabetical order of the project names). +
After that, add the new component to the components folder.

[[AddNewComponentGuide-5.Checkthesourcesandresources]]
5. Check the sources and resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source and resources have to follow some Apache/Camel coding rules:

* Make sure every added source and resource contains the Apache license
header.
* Make sure the new component has an adequate test coverage.
* Run a build with checkstyle to ensure the sources are conform with the
Apache Camel coding rules:
http://camel.apache.org/building.html[Building Camel] (look for
`Building with checkstyle`)
* Make sure the log output is adequate on the INFO log level.

[[AddNewComponentGuide-6.CheckwhetheralldependenciesareavailableasOSGIbundles]]
6. Check whether all dependencies are available as OSGI bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a dependency is not available as an OSGI bundle, ask the Apache
Servicemix guys for an OSGI-fied version of this dependency. You should
do this by opening a JIRA issue at
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SMX4 +
The issue type should be "Task". A sample can be found here:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SMX4-723

[[AddNewComponentGuide-7.Addanewfeature]]
7. Add a new feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a new feature definition for this component to the feature file
(under platforms/karaf/features). +
Next, validate the correctness of this feature file as described in
http://camel.apache.org/building.html[Working with features] (look for
`Working with features`)

[[AddNewComponentGuide-8.Addthewikipage]]
8. Add the wiki page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each component requires its own wiki page to document the component. If
you don't have the *karma* to edit the wiki pages, plese refer to
http://camel.apache.org/how-do-i-edit-the-website.html[how do I edit the
website]. +
Add the new component wiki page to the
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CAMEL/Components[Components]
list by editing
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CAMEL/Component+List[Component
List] wiki page. +
Add a reference to the new component to the
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CAMEL/Book+Component+Appendix[Manual]
wiki page. +
Update the release notes for the version the development is
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CAMEL/In+Progress[in
progress]. +
Check whether other sites needs to be updated.

[[AddNewComponentGuide-9.Runacompletebuild]]
9. Run a complete build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure you do not break the build, run a complete build from the new
component directory:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn clean install
----

[[AddNewComponentGuide-10.Addthecomponenttodistribution]]
10. Add the component to distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the new component to the following files

* parent/pom.xml
* apache-camel/src/main/descriptors/common-bin.xml

Build the kit by running the following maven goal from the
`apache-camel` directory:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn clean install
----

Check the generated .zip file in the target folder contains the new
component.
