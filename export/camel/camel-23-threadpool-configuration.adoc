[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-DesignNotesforThreadPoolConfiguration]]
Design Notes for ThreadPool Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-1588[CAMEL-1588] is the
ticket for a new and improved thread pool configuration for Apache
Camel. Its intended for Camel 2.3.

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-Scope]]
Scope
^^^^^

Camel uses thread pool in various places such as link:eip.html[EIP]
patterns, link:components.html[Components], link:async.html[Async] API
and whatnot. The aim is to improved and allow easier to configure those
thread pools in a more streamlined manner. The goal is to offer both a
fine grained configuration where you can tweak individual pools and have
more coarse grained configuration with fallback to _global_ settings
etc.

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-Outsidescope]]
Outside scope
+++++++++++++

Some components provides their own thread pool configuration and
management which Camel of course cannot and should not try to tailor
with. For example link:jetty.html[Jetty] is such an example.

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-UsagesofthreadpoolsinCamel]]
Usages of thread pools in Camel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently Camel uses thread pools in *camel-core* in the following
areas:

* `DefaultComponent` - Optional thread pool for components in need of
such
* `DefaultEndpoint` - Optional thread pool for endpoints in need of such
* `DefaultProducerTemplate` - Used by the link:async.html[Async] API of
this template
* `ScheduledPollConsumer` - Needs a `ScheduledExecutorService` to
schedule its tasks
* `RecipientListDefinition` - The link:recipient-list.html[Recipient
List] EIP pattern
* `SplitDefinition` - The link:splitter.html[Splitter] EIP pattern
* `ThreadsDefinition` - The `threads` DSL
* `ToDefinition` - Used by the `toAsync` variation
* `WireTapDefinition` - The link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] EIP pattern
* `MulticastProcessor` - The underlying thread pool
* `OnCompletionProcessor` - For sending async on completion routes
* `SendAsyncProcessor` - The `toAsync` processor variation
* `ThreadsProcessor` - The underlying thread pool
* `WireTapProcessor` - For sending async wire taps
* `SedaConsumer` - To support the `concurrentConsumers` and
`multipleConsumers` options (uses separate pools)

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-Existingconfiguration]]
Existing configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can configure the thread pool using the *setExecutorService* setter
methods that usually exists on those places where its in use. Some EIP
patterns offer a `executorServiceRef` option to refer to some pool to be
looked up in the link:registry.html[Registry].

We should ensure all EIPs can be configured to use a custom thread pool
in a nice and easy way. *DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-UsingdefaultThreadPools]]
Using default ThreadPools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We should use `CachedThreadPool` from the JDK Core as its the best
general purpose pool for many short lived tasks, which is what Camel
really does. Processing many messages in a short live. *DONE*

Only used SingleExecutorService for background tasks, and
ScheduledExecutorService for scheduled tasks *DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-ThreadPoolscope]]
ThreadPool scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It should be possible to configure a thread pool on either per
CamelContext level or per Route level, such as you can do with
AutoStartup and the likes. +
Then you can say, eg this route should use this pool, which have 20/50
in the pool size etc. *CHANGE OF PLAN*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-Threadpoolconfigurationbyrules]]
Thread pool configuration by rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It should be possible to to define a set of rules which matches which
thread pool a given source should use. +
It should be pattern based so you can say all EIPs should use this pool,
all endpoints that pool etc.

A ruleset something like this:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<threadPoolRule route="*" source="Aggregator" executorServiceRef="myAggPool"/>
<threadPoolRule route="*" source="To" executorServiceRef="mySendPool"/>
<threadPoolRule route="route3" source="*" executorServiceRef="myRoute3Pool"/>
----

Where it will match against route first, so if we got a route3 then it
will pick among those +
It should be possible to use wildcard and reg exp in the `route` and
`source` attributes.

Status: Consider for the future

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-Defaultthreadpoolprofile]]
Default thread pool profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It should be possible to set a default `ThreadPoolProfile` which Camel
will use when creating thread pools for the EIPs and whatnot. Then you
can set default settings and have that leveraged out of the box.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<threadPoolProfile id="myDefaultProfile"
                           defaultProfile="true"
                           poolSize="5" keepAliveTime="25" maxPoolSize="15" maxQueueSize="250" rejectedPolicy="Abort"/>
----

If none defined, then Camel should use a sensible default of

* poolSize = 10
* maxPoolSize = 20
* keepAliveTime = 60 seconds
* maxQueueSize = 1000
* rejectedPolicy = CallerRuns

And it should validate that only *one* `defaultProfile=true` can be set.

Status: *DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-Theproblemwithshutdownandrestartingpools]]
The problem with shutdown and restarting pools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ExecutorService API does not allow to restart a thread pool, which
is PITA. So we need to find a better strategy for stopping vs.
shutdown. +
Currently when we stop we also terminate the threadpool, and then
re-create it on start. This only works for default pools which we can
create again. +
But for custom thread pools we have no way to create them again as the
pool is already created when its given to us.

We may have to only shutdown thread pools if CamelContext is stopping.
And then if end user stop a route from JMX we can keep the thread pool
around. +
Only issue is the scheduled pool should stop scheduling tasks, which may
be a bit more trickier to avoid.

We have introduced a `ShutdownableService` to expose a `shutdown` method
which services can implement for their shutdown logic. +
Then we can only shutdown thread pools in `doShutdown()` and not as
before in `doStop()`.

By letting Camel keep track of created thread pool, then Camel knows
which pools shutdown when its stopping. Then the need for `doShutdown`
is not as apparent as before, but its good to have this state in the
lifecycles as well, for future needs.

Status: *DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-TheproblemwithComponent,Endpoint]]
The problem with Component, Endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The DefaultComponent and DefaultEndpoint exposes API to get an
ExecutorService. We should remove these API as you should use
`ExecutorServiceStrategy` from `CamelContext` to obtain a thread pool.
*DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-Managedthreadpool]]
Managed thread pool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check whether the thread pools is managed by default and avail in
JConsole. If not we should probably at least expose some read-only data
about the pools. *DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-SpringFactoryforcreatingcustompools]]
Spring Factory for creating custom pools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a Spring XML DSL for defining thread pools using custom options
such as corePoolSize, maxPoolSize, keepAlive, thread name etc. *DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-PluggableExecutorServiceSPI]]
Pluggable ExecutorService SPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We need a `org.apache.camel.spi.ExeuctorServieStrategy` which is
pluggable so end users can plugin their own strategy how to create
thread pools. They can leverage a WorkManager API from J2EE server etc.
*DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-Customizablethreadname]]
Customizable thread name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We should offer a simple pattern syntax so end users can customize the
pattern the thread name is created with: eg Something like:
`Camel Thread ${counter} - ${name`}. Where counter and suffix is dynamic
parameters. The counter is an unique incrementing thread counter. And
name is provided from the source which as a way to name thread, such as
a seda endpoint uri. *DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-EIPshouldmandateanExecutorService]]
EIP should mandate an ExecutorService
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the EIPS which leverages a ExecutorService, mandates its being
created and passed to it, we can enforce creating/lookup the pool during
route creation, which allows us to have the route information as well,
so we know which routes creates which pools. By passing in `null` we
loose this opportunity. +
That is why all the EIP Processors should be refactored to have
ExeuctorService as parameter. *DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-LetCamelkeeptrackofcreatedpools]]
Let Camel keep track of created pools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the `DefaultExecutorServiceStrategy` we can let Camel keep track
of the created pools, and thus also it can shutdown those when
CamelContext is shutting down. Then Camel is handling the lifecycle for
the pools it creates. And if you pass in a thread pool from an external
system then you manage that lifecycle. Camel will in those cases *not*
shut it down. *DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-Sensibledefaults]]
Sensible defaults
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `CachedExecutorService` by the JDK is maybe a bit aggressive as its
unbounded thread pool which essentially can create 1000s of threads if
the sever is not busy. But end users may want to have a reasonable max
size, lets say 100. So we should offer some sort of rule which you can
configure what the default settings should be for thread pools created
by Camel. *DONE*

[[Camel2.3-ThreadPoolConfiguration-Rejectionpolicy]]
Rejection policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We should add configuration about rejection policies for new tasks
submitted to a pool. The JDK has options for ABORT, RUN, WAIT, DISCARD
etc. *DONE*
