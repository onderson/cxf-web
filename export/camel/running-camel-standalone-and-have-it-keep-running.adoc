Running Camel standalone and have it keep running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using Camel as a standalone Java application, then Camel
provides a `Main` class you can reuse to more easily boot up Camel and
keep it running until the JVM terminates, for example when pressing
`ctrl + c`.

The `Main` class is provided in the following two components

* `camel-core` JAR in the `org.apache.camel.Main` class (requires Camel
2.6)
* `camel-spring` JAR in the `org.apache.camel.spring.Main` class

[[RunningCamelstandaloneandhaveitkeeprunning-Usingcamel-coreJARexample]]
Using `camel-core` JAR example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.6*

The following example shows how you can create your main class, named
`MainExample` and use the `Main` class from Camel.

[[RunningCamelstandaloneandhaveitkeeprunning-Usingcamel-springJARexample]]
Using `camel-spring` JAR example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This would be similar to the `camel-core` JAR example, however you would
use the `Main` class from the `org.apache.camel.spring` package. +
The `Main` class from `camel-spring` JAR has many more options and is
prepared for booting Camel from Spring XML files.
