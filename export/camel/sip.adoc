SIP Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.5*

The *sip* component in Camel is a communication component, based on the
Jain SIP implementation (available under the JCP license).

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an IETF-defined signaling protocol,
widely used for controlling multimedia communication sessions such as
voice and video calls over Internet Protocol (IP).The SIP protocol is an
Application Layer protocol designed to be independent of the underlying
transport layer; it can run on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User
Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).

The Jain SIP implementation supports TCP and UDP only.

The Camel SIP component *only* supports the SIP Publish and Subscribe
capability as described in the
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3903.txt[RFC3903 - Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event]

This camel component supports both producer and consumer endpoints.

Camel SIP Producers (Event Publishers) and SIP Consumers (Event
Subscribers) communicate event & state information to each other using
an intermediary entity called a SIP Presence Agent (a stateful brokering
entity).

For SIP based communication, a SIP Stack with a listener *must* be
instantiated on both the SIP Producer and Consumer (using separate ports
if using localhost). This is necessary in order to support the
handshakes & acknowledgements exchanged between the SIP Stacks during
communication.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-sip</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

[[Sip-URIformat]]
URI format
^^^^^^^^^^

The URI scheme for a sip endpoint is as follows:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
sip://johndoe@localhost:99999[?options]
sips://johndoe@localhost:99999/[?options]
----

This component supports producer and consumer endpoints for both TCP and
UDP.

You can append query options to the URI in the following format,
`?option=value&option=value&...`

[[Sip-Options]]
Options
^^^^^^^

The SIP Component offers an extensive set of configuration options &
capability to create custom stateful headers needed to propagate state
via the SIP protocol.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Default Value |Description
|`stackName` |`NAME_NOT_SET` |Name of the SIP Stack instance associated
with an SIP Endpoint.

|`transport` |`tcp` |Setting for choice of transport potocol. Valid
choices are "tcp" or "udp".

|`fromUser` |  |Username of the message originator. *Mandatory setting
unless a registry based custom FromHeader is specified.*

|`fromHost` |  |Hostname of the message originator. *Mandatory setting
unless a registry based FromHeader is specified*

|`fromPort` |  |Port of the message originator. *Mandatory setting
unless a registry based FromHeader is specified*

|`toUser` |  |Username of the message receiver. *Mandatory setting
unless a registry based custom ToHeader is specified.*

|`toHost` |  |Hostname of the message receiver. *Mandatory setting
unless a registry based ToHeader is specified*

|`toPort` |  |Portname of the message receiver. *Mandatory setting
unless a registry based ToHeader is specified*

|`maxforwards` |0 |the number of intermediaries that may forward the
message to the message receiver. *Optional setting. May alternatively be
set using as registry based MaxForwardsHeader*

|`eventId` |  |Setting for a String based event Id. *Mandatory setting
unless a registry based FromHeader is specified*

|`eventHeaderName` |  |Setting for a String based event Id. *Mandatory
setting unless a registry based FromHeader is specified*

|`maxMessageSize` |`1048576` |Setting for maximum allowed Message size
in bytes.

|`cacheConnections` |`false` |Should connections be cached by the
SipStack to reduce cost of connection creation. This is useful if the
connection is used for long running conversations.

|`consumer` |`false` |This setting is used to determine whether the kind
of header (FromHeader,ToHeader etc) that needs to be created for this
endpoint

|`contentType` |`text` |Setting for contentType can be set to any valid
MimeType.

|`contentSubType` |`xml` |Setting for contentSubType can be set to any
valid MimeSubType.

|`receiveTimeoutMillis` |`10000` |Setting for specifying amount of time
to wait for a Response and/or Acknowledgement can be received from
another SIP stack

|`useRouterForAllUris` |`false` |This setting is used when requests are
sent to the Presence Agent via a proxy.

|`msgExpiration` |`3600` |The amount of time a message received at an
endpoint is considered valid

|`presenceAgent` |`false` |This setting is used to distingish between a
Presence Agent & a consumer. This is due to the fact that the SIP Camel
component ships with a basic Presence Agent (for testing purposes only).
Consumers have to set this flag to true.

[[Sip-RegistrybasedOptions]]
Registry based Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SIP requires a number of headers to be sent/received as part of a
request. These SIP header can be enlisted in the
link:registry.html[Registry], such as in the Spring XML file.

The values that could be passed in, are the following:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Description
|`fromHeader` |a custom Header object containing message originator
settings. Must implement the type javax.sip.header.FromHeader

|`toHeader` |a custom Header object containing message receiver
settings. Must implement the type javax.sip.header.ToHeader

|`viaHeaders` |List of custom Header objects of the type
javax.sip.header.ViaHeader. Each ViaHeader containing a proxy address
for request forwarding. (Note this header is automatically updated by
each proxy when the request arrives at its listener)

|`contentTypeHeader` |a custom Header object containing message content
details. Must implement the type javax.sip.header.ContentTypeHeader

|`callIdHeader` |a custom Header object containing call details. Must
implement the type javax.sip.header.CallIdHeader

|`maxForwardsHeader` |a custom Header object containing details on
maximum proxy forwards. This header places a limit on the viaHeaders
possible. Must implement the type javax.sip.header.MaxForwardsHeader

|`eventHeader` |a custom Header object containing event details. Must
implement the type javax.sip.header.EventHeader

|`contactHeader` |an optional custom Header object containing verbose

Sending Messages to/from a SIP endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[Sip-CreatingaCamelSIPPublisher]]
Creating a Camel SIP Publisher
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the example below, a SIP Publisher is created to send SIP Event
publications to +
a user "agent@localhost:5152". This is the address of the SIP Presence
Agent which acts as a broker between the SIP Publisher and Subscriber

* using a SIP Stack named client
* using a registry based eventHeader called evtHdrName
* using a registry based eventId called evtId
* from a SIP Stack with Listener set up as user2@localhost:3534
* The Event being published is EVENT_A
* A Mandatory Header called REQUEST_METHOD is set to Request.Publish
thereby setting up the endpoint as a Event publisher"

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
producerTemplate.sendBodyAndHeader(  
    "sip://agent@localhost:5152?stackName=client&eventHeaderName=evtHdrName&eventId=evtid&fromUser=user2&fromHost=localhost&fromPort=3534",   
    "EVENT_A",  
    "REQUEST_METHOD",   
    Request.PUBLISH);

[[Sip-CreatingaCamelSIPSubscriber]]
Creating a Camel SIP Subscriber
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the example below, a SIP Subscriber is created to receive SIP Event
publications sent to +
a user "johndoe@localhost:5154"

* using a SIP Stack named Subscriber
* registering with a Presence Agent user called agent@localhost:5152
* using a registry based eventHeader called evtHdrName. The evtHdrName
contains the Event which is se to "Event_A"
* using a registry based eventId called evtId

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]

@Override  
protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {  
    return new RouteBuilder() {  
        @Override  
        public void configure() throws Exception {    
            // Create PresenceAgent  
            from("sip://agent@localhost:5152?stackName=PresenceAgent&presenceAgent=true&eventHeaderName=evtHdrName&eventId=evtid")

            // Create Sip Consumer(Event Subscriber)  
            from("sip://johndoe@localhost:5154?stackName=Subscriber&toUser=agent&toHost=localhost&toPort=5152&eventHeaderName=evtHdrName&eventId=evtid")  
                .to("log:ReceivedEvent?level=DEBUG")  
                .to("mock:notification");  
                  
        }  
    };  
}  
----

*The Camel SIP component also ships with a Presence Agent that is meant
to be used for Testing and Demo purposes only.* An example of
instantiating a Presence Agent is given above.

Note that the Presence Agent is set up as a user agent@localhost:5152
and is capable of communicating with both Publisher as well as
Subscriber. It has a separate SIP stackName distinct from Publisher as
well as Subscriber. While it is set up as a Camel Consumer, it does not
actually send any messages along the route to the endpoint
"mock:neverland".
