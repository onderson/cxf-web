camel:embedded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *camel:embedded* goal of the link:camel-maven-plugin.html[Camel
Maven Plugin] is used to run your Camel link:spring.html[Spring]
configurations in the same JVM as Maven, so it should startup a bit
faster than link:camel-run-maven-goal.html[camel:run]. Though sometimes
we all get the odd classpath issue; so sometimes forking a new JVM can
work around any strange Maven classpath issues.

A good example application to get you started is the
link:spring-example.html[Spring Example].
