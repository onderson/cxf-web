In camel there are a number of components that use the http protocol
headers to do their business. +
The components include camel-http, camel-jetty, camel-restlet,
camel-cxf, etc. +
If you are using these component, you may pay attention to the Http
protocol headers:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
  Exchange.CONTENT_ENCODING
  Exchange.CONTENT_TYPE
  Exchange.HTTP_BASE_URI
  Exchange.HTTP_CHARACTER_ENCODING
  Exchange.HTTP_METHOD
  Exchange.HTTP_PATH
  Exchange.HTTP_QUERY
  Exchange.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE
----

If you don't want these headers to bother your other endpoints, you can
remove these headers as follows:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
  from("jetty://http://myhost:9000/myservice/")
    // Remove the header which name is start with CamelHttp, this DSL is new to Camel 2.3.0
    // You can use removeHeader if your camel version is lower than 2.3.0
    .removeHeaders("CamelHttp*")
    .to("otherEndpoint");
----

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
  <camelContext id="camel" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">
    <route>
      <from uri="jetty://http://myhost:9000/myservice/"/>
      <removeHeaders pattern="CamelHttp*" />
      <to uri="otherEndpoint"/>
    </route>
  </camelContext>
