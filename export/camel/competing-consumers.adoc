Competing Consumers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Camel supports the
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/CompetingConsumers.html[Competing
Consumers] from the link:enterprise-integration-patterns.html[EIP
patterns] using a few different components.

You can use the following components to implement competing consumers:-

* link:seda.html[Seda] for SEDA based concurrent processing using a
thread pool
* link:jms.html[JMS] for distributed SEDA based concurrent processing
with queues which support reliable load balancing, failover and
clustering.

[[CompetingConsumers-EnablingCompetingConsumerswithJMS]]
Enabling Competing Consumers with JMS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable Competing Consumers you just need to set the
*concurrentConsumers* property on the link:jms.html[JMS] endpoint.

For example

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("jms:MyQueue?concurrentConsumers=5").bean(SomeBean.class);
----

or in Spring DSL

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<route>
  <from uri="jms:MyQueue?concurrentConsumers=5"/>
  <to uri="bean:someBean"/>
</route>
----

Or just run multiple JVMs of any link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ] or
link:jms.html[JMS] route

[[CompetingConsumers-UsingThisPattern]]
Using This Pattern
++++++++++++++++++

If you would like to use this EIP Pattern then please read the
link:getting-started.html[Getting Started], you may also find the
link:architecture.html[Architecture] useful particularly the description
of link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] and link:uris.html[URIs]. Then you could
try out some of the link:examples.html[Examples] first before trying
this pattern out.
