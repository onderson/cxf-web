[[Camel2.11.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.11.0 release with approximately 679 issues resolved -
including new features, improvements, and bug fixes, such as:

* link:rx.html[Camel RX] provides a typesafe and composable API for
working with asynchronous events from camel endpoints using
https://rx.codeplex.com/[Reactive Extensions] using the
https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/wiki[RxJava library]
* Added link:binding.html[Binding] support, so it is easy to combine
things like a link:data-format.html[Data Format] to an
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] for easier composition of routes.
* Added support for SOAP 1.2 in link:soap.html[SOAP] data format.
* link:cache.html[Cache] operation for add/update now supports expiry
headers to control time to live/idle/eternal.
* Added `allowNullBody` option to link:jms.html[JMS] to configure
whether sending messages with no body is allowed.
* Added `connectOnStartup` option to link:hdfs.html[HDFS] to allow to
connect on demand, to avoid having Hadoop block for long time connecting
to the HDFS cluster, as it has a hardcoded 15 minute retry mechanism.
* Added support for daily and weekly trends to
link:twitter.html[Twitter] component.
* The link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel Maven Archetypes] now
generates projects without any license headers.
* Added `rejectOld` option to the link:resequencer.html[Resequencer] to
prevent out of order messages from being delivered after
capacity/timeout events occur
* Further optimized link:xpath.html[XPath] under concurrent load, and as
well ensured resources are cleaned up eagerly
* Added options `allowNullBody` and `readLockMinLength` to the
link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] components.
* Made `changed` read lock strategy on link:ftp2.html[FTP] go faster (eg
when the FTP server has a lot of files in the directory) if you enable
the `fastExistsCheck=true` option as well. Notice that some FTP server
may not support this.
* link:hl7.html[HL7] moves to HAPI 2.0 and supports using a dedicated
Parser instance in the link:hl7.html[HL7] MLLP codec and DataFormat.
Added "Terser" language and expression to be able to extract fields from
a parsed message. link:hl7.html[HL7] now uses Apache Mina 2.x.
* Add an option `HttpMethodRestrict` to restrict HTTP method in
link:jetty.html[Jetty] and link:servlet.html[SERVLET]
* Add support for selection of link:direct-vm.html[Direct-VM] consumers
by using ant-like path expression.
* The link:pojo-producing.html[POJO Producing], and
link:pojo-consuming.html[POJO Consuming] with @Consume, @Produce,
@EndpointInject now supports a new `property` attribute to get the
endpoint configuration from a bean property (eg using a getter method);
this allows you to configure this on the bean using conventional bean
configuration.
* Testing with `camel-test-blueprint` on Windows no longer tries to
cleanup after testing taking up 5 seconds and logging WARNs.
* The link:file2.html[File], and link:ftp2.html[FTP] components now
support `fileExist=Move` option to move any existing files before
writing a file.
* Added option `loadStatisticsEnabled` on link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX]
to allow to disable load statistics if not needed (avoids a background
thread being in use, to calculate the load stats).
* Enabled "lazy connections" for link:xmpp.html[XMPP] providers via the
`testConnectionOnStartup` option
* Added a connection monitor to detect and fix dropped
link:xmpp.html[XMPP] consumer connections at configurable
`connectionPollDelay` intervals
* Added an `org.apache.camel.builder.ExchangeBuilder` to build the
link:exchange.html[Exchange] using a builder pattern.
* The link:camel-run-maven-goal.html[Camel Run Maven Goal] can now run
link:cdi.html[CDI] applications.
* The Camel link:cdi.html[CDI] component has improved a lot.
* Added option `allowRedeliveryWhileStopping` to
link:dead-letter-channel.html[error handlers] to control if redelivery
is allowed during stopping/shutting down Camel or the route(s). Turning
this option `false` allows to stop quicker by rejecting redelivery
attempts.
* Added support for specifying user info in Camel
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] urls, which contains the @ sign; now the @
sign can be given as is; without being encoded to %40.
* Added robust connection support for link:jmx.html[JMX]. Optional
`testConnectionOnStartup` allows a JMX consumer to attach to a JMX
server that becomes available _after_ the JMX endpoint starts;
`reconnectOnConnectionFailure` enables re-connection of failed JMX
connections.
* link:jaxb.html[JAXB] and link:soap.html[SOAP] data format now supports
controlling namespace prefix mappings when marshalling (eg to avoid
prefixes such as ns2, ns3, ns4 etc.)
* Added support for using raw uris when link:component.html[Component]s
create link:endpoint.html[Endpoint]s. This gives component writers full
power in case their component has special syntax/notation for endpoint
uri configurations.
* link:eip.html[EIP]s configured with custom `AggregationStrategy` will
now strict check the custom strategy exists in the
link:registry.html[Registry] and no longer fallback and use a default
strategy if not.
* Camel now logs on shutdown if any thread pools hasn't been properly
shutdown, and will shutdown them as fail safe (can only be done for the
thread pools Camel manages).
* The buffer size of link:stream-caching.html[Stream caching] is now
configurable.
* Improved startup performance.
* Added link:jms.html[JMS] URI option
`messageListenerContainerFactoryRef` which allows you to specify a
`MessageListenerContainerFactory` to determine what
`org.springframework.jms.listener.AbstractMessageListenerContainer` to
use to consume messages.
* link:mqtt.html[MQTT] producer now leverages the
link:asynchronous-routing-engine.html[Asynchronous Routing Engine]
* The link:netty.html[Netty] producer scales up and down much better by
leveraging a channel pool.
* Added new link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel Maven Archetypes] for
creating Camel and Groovy applications.
* Added a link:groovy-dsl.html[Groovy DSL] that allows to use Groovy
closures and Groovy XML parsing in routes.
* Camel now injects `CamelContext` on `Language` and `DataFormat` that
implements `CamelContextAware`
* Thread pools in Camel with `maximumQueueSize` of 0 or negative will
now not use a worker queue but do direct hand-over to thread instead.
* link:simple.html[Simple] unary operators for inc and dec must now have
function on left hand side, to be parsed as unary function. Otherwise
its now regarded as literal.
* Custom assigned id's on Camel link:routes.html[Routes] is now
validated on starting the routes, that they must be unique within the
same CamelContext.
* Added `AbstractListAggregationStrategy` abstract class to make it
easier to link:aggregator2.html[aggregate] into a List<V> using a custom
`AggregationStrategy`.
* link:eip.html[EIP]s which support using `AggregationStrategy` now
control the lifecycle of the strategy; allowing end users to do custom
logic in the start/stop methods of their strategy implementation.
* Added option `includeSentJMSMessageID` to link:jms.html[JMS] to allow
to enrich Camel Message with the actual JMSMessageID for the sent
message. Can be used by end users for logging purpose etc.
* Added option `allowShortLines` and `ignoreExtraColumns` to
link:flatpack-dataformat.html[Flatpack data format].
* link:mail.html[Mail] consumer now supports using search terms to
filter mails by terms such as subject, from, body, sent date etc.
* The cached script file in the link:language.html[Language] component
can now be cleared via JMX.
* improved the karaf context-info command by adding a verbose mode to
view endpoints list (now hidden by default) and adding stats on the
number of active/inactive routes
* Added support for `UpdateList`, `DeleteList` and `ExecutorType` to
link:mybatis.html[MyBatis] component.
* Added support for easier configuration of using concurrent message
listener consumer when doing request/reply over link:jms.html[JMS], by
leveraging the existing `concurrentConsumers` and
`maxConcurrentConsumers` options.
* Improved the link:smpp.html[SMPP] consumer to expose more data by
receiving a `DeliverSM` message, including the optional parameters.
* Camels link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[property placeholders] can
now be used in route id / node id's in the routes in XML and Java DSLs,
eg <route id="`coolName`">
* The thread name pattern can easily be configured on <camelContext>
with the new threadNamePattern attribute
* Camel now validates link:seda.html[SEDA] and link:vm.html[VM]
endpoints using same queue name, that if any queue size is in use, that
size must match. As well Camel logs at INFO level when starting up the
queues and the sizes. This allows end users to easily spot any issues if
mistakenly using different queue sizes for the same queue names.
* Added link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] operations to link:log.html[throughput
logger] so you can get stats and also reset the stats at runtime.
* Added ACL support on the link:aws-s3.html[AWS-S3] component.
* Allow to configure link:jetty.html[Jetty] http client thread pool
settings in uri to make it easier to have different settings per
endpoint.
* Added support for implied decimal formats to link:bindy.html[Bindy]
* Added option `backlog` to link:netty.html[Netty] which can be used to
allow more concurrent clients to connect to a link:netty.html[Netty]
consumer.
* Added support for parsing CSV if a field has a ' (single quote) at
it's beging
* Added support for using custom url rewrite plugins in
link:http.html[HTTP], link:http4.html[HTTP4], and link:jetty.html[Jetty]
producers, which gives more control of url mappings, such as when
bridging/proxying http based routes. Provided `camel-urlrewrite` as out
of the box implementation.
* Improved the link:springintegration.html[Spring-Integration] consumer
to also send back the message headers.
* The Camel link:guice.html[Guice] component has been upgraded to latest
Guice 3.0, and no longer dependent on Guice extension project
`guiceyfruit`.
* ReplyTo Temporary Queue now refreshed when the underlying
link:jms.html[JMS] Connection fails.
* When processing an link:exchange.html[Exchange] fails, the failed
route id is available for end users. See details at
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel].
* When using link:xslt.html[XSLT] includes will use same file or
classpath loading as endpoint configuration, if not explicit configured.
* Now link:camel-transport-for-cxf.html[Camel Transport for CXF]
supports to configure with blueprint.
* link:sql-component.html[SQL Component] now supports named parameters
in the queries.
* link:sql-component.html[SQL Component] now supports
link:batch-consumer.html[Batch Consumer] to consume data; for example to
pickup new rows being inserted into a table. As well having queries
being execute after each row has been processed, such as
deleting/marking the row as processed.
* JDBC based link:sql-component.html[aggregation repository] now allows
to store message body and headers as text in individual columns. This
makes the data human readable, as by default the data is stored as
binary.
* link:file2.html[File] consumer will on first poll run the check to
delete old orphaned lock files. As opposed to before where this happened
during startup of Camel itself; which could delay starting Camel if the
delete process takes a long time.
* link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] can now use a custom
idempotent key with the built-in idempotent consumer. For example you
can now use both the file name and size as key.
* link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] producers support the
`CamelOverruleFileName` header as a use once and discard header to
overrule and use as filename for writing; while preserving the original
filename in the `CamelFileName` header.
* The link:languages.html[Languages] and link:language.html[Language]
component can now load the script from external resource using
`"resource:scheme:location"` syntax.
* link:hdfs.html[HDFS] producer without a split strategy will now close
file stream after writing. You can use the `CamelHdfsClose` header to
explicit to control if to close file stream or not.
* link:simple.html[Simple] language now has `type` function to refer to
a type, enum or constant field.
* Using `allowRedeliveryWhileStopping=false` on
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] now moves the message
to the DLC (when stopping) instead of rejecting the message.
* Unit testing with link:blueprint-testing.html[Blueprint Testing] is
now easier to override Blueprint property placeholder values from both
external .cfg files, as well from placeholders defined directly in the
XML file. See further details at
link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Using PropertyPlaceholder] page.
* link:bindy.html[Bindy] FixedLengthRecord is improved with support for
header and footer records, delimited fields, and field lengths defined
within a record.
* Added `transacted` option to link:hazelcast-component.html[Hazelcast
SEDA consumer] to use Hazelcast transaction.
* Improved performance of link:simple.html[Simple] and
link:bean.html[Bean] language when using OGNL expression, by leveraging
an internal cache to avoid introspecting the same types over and over
again.
* Camel now validates better when using link:try-catch-finally.html[Try
Catch Finally] in the routes has been configured properly.
* Added link:karaf.html[Karaf] commands for using the
link:backlogtracer.html[BacklogTracer] when running Camel application in
a Apache Karaf container.
* The link:vm.html[VM] component can now safely communicate Camel
Contexts residing in different bundles in an OSGi environment, as the
issue leading to an incoherent state when restarting one of the bundles
has been fixed.
* Made it easy to use Saxon as the transformer with the
link:xslt.html[XSLT] component.
* Improved link:aws.html[AWS] to not only support the Amazon provided
clients for accessing the services.* Improved link:aws.html[AWS] to not
only support the Amazon provided clients for accessing the services.
* Added multiple consumers support to link:guava-eventbus.html[Guava
EventBus] endpoints.
* Added support for listener interfaces to
link:guava-eventbus.html[Guava EventBus] in order to provide better
`DeadEvent` handling.
* Made it easier to configure options such as passwords on Camel
endpoint link:uris.html[URIs] and use the value _as is_, using the new
RAW token. See more details at
link:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.html[How Do I Configure Endpoints?]
* Improved link:flatpack.html[Flatpack] and
link:flatpack-dataformat.html[Flatpack DataFormat] to allow short lines
and ignore extra columns.
* Fully customize the output of the link:log.html[Log] component by
providing a custom `ExchangeFormatter`.
* You can now configure more options on link:json.html[GSON Data
format], for example field mapping strategies.
* Simplified consuming REST requests with link:cxfrs.html[CXFRS] with
the _Simple Binding Style_.
* Improve link:jaxb.html[JAXB] to support validation by
marshaling/unmarshaling objects from/to XML.
* Improved
link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[`org.apache.camel.spring.spi.BridgePropertyPlaceholderConfigurer`]
to support both Camel and Spring property placeholder syntax in the
.properties files.
* New link:karaf.html[Karaf] commands for using the
link:backlogtracer.html[BacklogTracer] as well for profile routes.

recovery is enabled and a in progress exchange was completed after the
recovery scan was executed, and before the recover task kicks in.
* Fixed using endpoint reference options in link:uris.html[URIs] (eg
#beanName) to use the class type of the setter method to support looking
up beans from the OSGI Service Registry.
* Fixed link:simple.html[Simple] language when using `bean` function to
support specifying parameter values containing comma not being parsed

[[Camel2.11.0Release-APIchanges/breaking]]
API changes/breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* link:hl7.html[HL7] upgraded to now use Apache Mina 2.x.
* Renamed `org.apache.camel.component.hbase.HBaseContats` to
`org.apache.camel.component.hbase.HBaseConstants`
* Added getter/setter methods for loadStatisticsEnabled on
`org.apache.camel.spi.ManagementStrategy`
* Added `shutdownGraceful`, and `awaitTermination` methods to
`ExecutorServiceManager` to make it easier to shutdown a thread pool
gracefully waiting for its tasks to complete.
* Added method `useRawUri()` to `org.apache.camel.Component` to allow
link:component.html[Component]s to use raw uri when creating endpoints.
(by default the uri has been encoded prior to creation).
* Added method `newThread` to
`org.apache.camel.spi.ExecutorServiceManager` to create a new thread
without using a thread pool.
* Added support to parse CSV if a field has a ' (single quote) at it's
beging, this made camel-csv doesn't support the field which is quoted
with ' (single quote) or "(double quote) at the same time.

[[Camel2.11.0Release-Internal/NonAPIrefactoringsthatmayaffectusers]]
Internal/Non API refactorings that may affect users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The link:testing.html[Camel Test Kit] provides a default
link:properties.html[Properties] component out of the box; which mean
using `addComponent("properties", ...)` is no longer needed; instead get
the component using `getComponent("properties")` and configure the
component instead.
* Minor adjustments to `org.apache.camel.builder.ErrorHandlerBuilder`.
* `LRUCache` will attempt to stop service on eviction of entry.
* Removed `org.apache.camel.model.NodeFactory` as its no longer
applicable.
* Added `getCamelContext()` methods to `ProducerTemplate`, and
`ConsumerTemplate`
* The method `isMatched` on `GenericFileConsumer` is now abstract and
has an extra parameter.
* The link:testing.html[Camel Test Kit] removed the support of JUnit3,
please use JUnit4 version instead.
* The method `prepareOnStartup` on
`org.apache.camel.component.file.GenericFileProcessStrategy` is now
executed on first poll instead of starting the route; as if the job
takes a long time, it will block Camel from starting other routes. If
the job takes more than 1 second to run then its logged at INFO level so
people can easier spot if the task takes a longer time, than usual.
* link:hdfs.html[HDFS] producer without a split strategy will now close
file stream after writing. You can use the `CamelHdfsClose` header to
explicit to control if to close file stream or not.
* The type for file last modified header is changed from
`java.util.Date` to `long`
* Removed class
`org.apache.camel.component.gae.context.GaeSpringCamelContext` from
`camel-gae`
* Using `allowRedeliveryWhileStopping=false` on
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] now moves the message
to the DLC (when stopping) instead of rejecting the message.
* When using link:spring.html[Spring] with Camel, then Camel will now
lookup in Spring's ancestor application contexts as well, when using the
link:registry.html[Registry]
* The JMX MBean name for the link:tracer.html[Tracer] has removed the
identity hash code, eg
`org.apache.camel:context=localhost/camel-1,type=tracer,name=Tracer(0x548bb8b2)`
is now named
`org.apache.camel:context=localhost/camel-1,type=tracer,name=Tracer`.
* The link:xslt.html[XSLT] component will now fail if the
\{\{transformerFactoryClass} cannot be loaded on the classpath, instead
of logging a WARN.
* The link:sql-component.html[SQL] producer will only access the message
body if there is query parameters to prepare in the SQL to execute (eg
using ? or :name).
* The `preMove` option on link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP]
consumers is now run after the file read lock has been acquired.

[[Camel2.11.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The link:tracer.html[Tracer] may not output all details for some
situations, such as when using `onCompletion` or `intercept`, etc.
* The project cannot fully build the site using Maven (e.g. running
`"mvn site"`). There is no plan to fix this, as the project does not use
maven site.
* JBoss 7 may log a WARNing when running Camel as a WAR file.
* link:cxf-example-osgi.html[CXF Example OSGi] doesn't work without
enabling dynamic imports for this bundle.
* The link:ftp2.html[FTP] component may have issues for Windows clients
or servers in the 2.11.0 release. Downgrading to use commons-net 3.1 may
fix this, see
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-6219[CAMEL-6219]

[[Camel2.11.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Spring 3.0.x support is @deprecated and some of the camel-spring
components require Spring 3.1 onwards.
* Apache Camel Karaf features now uses Spring version range "[3.1,4)" as
Spring 3.1 is now required as minimum Spring version.
* `camel-mina2` now uses `OrderedThreadPoolExecutor` by default. There
is a new option `orderedThreadPoolExecutor` you can configure it to
`false` to revert back to unordered if needed. If using SSL etc. then
ordered is required to be used.
* `camel-netty` now uses `OrderedMemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor` by
default. There is a new option `orderedThreadPoolExecutor` you can
configure it to false to revert back to unordered if needed. If using
SSL etc. then ordered is required to be used.
* The default value of the `delay` option on link:timer.html[Timer] has
been changed from `0` to `1000`
* The default value of the `convertLFtoCR` option of the
link:hl7.html[HL7] MLLP codec has been changed from `true` to `false`.
Likewise, the link:hl7.html[HL7] DataFormat and TypeConverter do not
perform this conversion anymore.
* The link:simple.html[Simple] language has limited its support for the
escape character to only new line, carriage return and tab characters.
This makes it easier to use back-slash characters in the
link:simple.html[Simple] language without double escaping etc.
* `camel-netty` now requires `commons-pool` as dependency.
* The `maximumQueueSize` of
http://camel.apache.org/threading-model.html[Thread Pools] and
http://camel.apache.org/threading-model.html[Thread Pool Profiles] with
values 0 or negative now means disable the worker queue, and use
direct-handover. If you want an unbounded queue size, then set the
`maximumQueueSize` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` which was what the previous
code did.
* Custom assigned id's on Camel link:routes.html[Routes] is now
validated on starting the routes, that they must be unique within the
same CamelContext.
* `camel-blueprint` now requires Apache Aries 1.0, and OSGi 4.3.0.
* Removed @deprecated classes form `camel-spring` in the
`org.apache.camel.component` package which was causing split-package
issue with OSGi. Component authors who are using these @deprecated
classes, should migrate to use equivalent classes from `camel-core` in
the same package.
* The default Spring version is upgraded from 3.0.7 to 3.1.3 out of the
box.
* Camel now validates link:seda.html[SEDA] and link:vm.html[VM]
endpoints using same queue name, that if any queue size is in use, that
size must match. As well Camel logs at INFO level when starting up the
queues and the sizes. This allows end users to easily spot any issues if
mistakenly using different queue sizes for the same queue names.
* The link:zookeeper.html[Zookeeper endpoint] `awaitExistence` option
has been marked as @deprecated and is removed from it's documentation as
it's usage would have no effect in the current codebase.
* Marked the 2 classes in the `junit4` package from `camel-test-spring`
component as @deprecated, and refer to use the classes from the `spring`
package instead.
* If using link:xslt.html[XSLT] with includes, then mind that if not
explicit defined file: or classpath: as prefix in xsl:include, then
Camel will now use the same as configured on the endpoint. Before
"classpath:" was always used as fallback, despite endpoint could have
been configured with "file:".
* `camel-scala` has been upgraded to Scala 2.10.1, there is a
`camel-scala_2.9` module that is built against Scala 2.9.2. Though
`camel-scala_2.9` is deprecated and expected to be removed in the next
bigger release (eg Camel 2.12/3.0).
* `camel-gae` now longer has Spring dependency, and we removed class
`org.apache.camel.component.gae.context.GaeSpringCamelContext`.
* `camel-jackson` has upgraded from Jackson 1.x to 2.x.
* link:type-converter.html[Type Converter] utilizations statistics has
been disabled by default, due there is a little performance impact under
very high concurrent load. You can enable the statistics easily as
documented at link:type-converter.html[Type Converter].

[[Camel2.11.0Release-Notice]]
Notice
~~~~~~

* Maven 3.0.4 or better is required to build the
link:source.html[Source]
* Apache Karaf 2.3.1 or better is required for deploying Camel 2.11
onwards, when using Apache Karaf.
* Spring 3.1 is now required as minimum Spring version. Spring 3.0 is
@deprecated and only partially supported with this Camel release.
