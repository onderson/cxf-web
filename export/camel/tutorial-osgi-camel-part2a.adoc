Transform existing projects into bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To convert a project into a bundle a couple of things/steps must be done
:

\1) Declare the project in the maven pom.xml file as of type
<packaging>bundle</packaging>, +
2) Add the maven felix plugin who will generate the MANIFEST.MF file, +
3) Identify the packages to be imported/exported and version, +
4) Identify and register OSGI services when they are used by another
bundle.

Spring team has created the Spring Dynamic Modules project to facilitate
the work of the developer working with OSGI specification. It allows to
transform existing spring beans (interface + implemented class) into
OSGI services reachable by any bundle deployed. In fact the services are
declared in a repository under the form of interfaces. This mechanism is
known now as blueprint services or RFC 124 and is currently integrated
under the
http://www.osgi.org/Download/File?url=/download/osgi-4.2-early-draft3.pdf[OSGI
specification R4.2].

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part2a-Step1:reportincident.model]]
Step 1 : reportincident.model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To transform the reportincident.model project, we will execute the steps
1) 2) and 3) because no services must be registered for this project.
So, update the pom.xml file created and add/change what is put in the
code below in XML comment with word STEP

Remarks :

* The model bundle does not need to import 'specific' packages so the
tag <Import-Packages> can be skipped but packages will be added
automatically +
by the felix/bnd tool to the MANIFEST.MF file if import statements are
defined in the classes or maven dependencies are declared
* The tag <_failok>true</_failok> is added to inform the plugin that it
can continue the creation of the MANIFEST.MF file even if an
error/warning occurs. This is the case here because files located under
META-INF directory must be exported.
* The hibernate file must be exported with the classpath of the bundle.
This is why the line
'=META-INF.org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.model' has +
been added to export the packagename containing this file

When the pom.xml has been updated, you can execute the following maven
command :

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn clean install org.ops4j:maven-pax-plugin:eclipse
----

the goal org.ops4j:maven-pax-plugin:eclipse is added to refresh the
MANIFEST.MF file created

This command will generate a jar file containing the classes, hibernate
file and MANIFEST.MF file and deploy it in your maven local repository.
You can open the jar and check if the the content of MANIFEST.MF is
similar to

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]

It is time to continue with the persistence project where we will
introduce new important concepts

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part2a-Step2:reportincident.persistence]]
Step 2 : reportincident.persistence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, you have to replace the pom.xml file created with the file
provided in the project attached (see resource). If you open this file,
you will see that the <Import-Package> section of the maven-felix-plugin
has been enriched with the packages required to work with Hibernate,
Spring and JTA classes.

Nevertheless, it is interesting to mention that we have exported the
package `org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.dao` and defined
`org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.dao.impl` as private. Why, the
reason is very simple, we would like to export only the interface to
another 'service' bundles and keep internally the implementation.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<Private-Package>org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.dao.impl</Private-Package>
    <Export-Package>org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.dao</Export-Package>
----

[Tip]
====


Discovering all the classes used by a third party library like Hibernate
can be cumbersome and takes time. An interesting alternative is to use
the command 'DynamicImport-Package' to resolve classloading issue.
<DynamicImport-Package> *</DynamicImport-Package>

====

In order to test the tip, update your pom.xml with the following info :

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<Import-Package>
    META-INF.org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.model,
    com.mysql.jdbc,
    org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.model,
    org.apache.commons.dbcp,
    *
    </Import-Package>
    <Private-Package>
    org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.dao.impl
    </Private-Package>
    <Export-Package>
    org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.dao
    </Export-Package>
    <DynamicImport-Package>*</DynamicImport-Package>
----

and look at the result generated by the plugin. The Import-Package
section is dry.

Now that our pom.xml is configured we will modified our spring.xml files
to allow our DAO service to be registered as a OSGI service. Why,
because the classes of the bundle reportincident.service uses this DAO
class but required also additional functionalities like (Hibernate
SessionFactory, Spring Transaction management, ...) who will be
instantiated and configured when the persistence bundle/service will be
started.

Additional motivations are also provided in the OSGI specification :

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_Enterprise application developers working with technologies such as
those described in chapter 2 would like to be_ +
_able to take advantage of the OSGi platform. The core features of
enterprise programming models previously_ +
_described must be retained for enterprise applications deployed in
OSGi. The current OSGi specifications are_ +
_lacking in the following areas with respect to this requirement:_ +
_• There is no defined component model for the internal content of a
bundle. Declarative Services only_ +
_supports the declaration of components that are publicly exposed._ +
_• The configuration (property injection) and assembly (collaborator
injection) support is very basic_ +
_compared to the functionality offered by frameworks such as Spring._ +
_• There is no model for declarative specification of services that cut
across several components (aspects or_ +
_aspect-like functionality)_ +
_• Components that interact with the OSGi runtime frequently need to
depend on OSGi APIs, meaning that_ +
_unit testing outside of an OSGi runtime is problematic_ +
_• The set of types and resources visible from the context class loader
is unspecified. The context class_ +
_loader is heavily used in enterprise application libraries_ +
_• Better tolerance of the dynamic aspects of the OSGi platform is
required. The programming model should_ +
_make it easy to deal with services that may come and go, and with
collections of such services, via simple_ +
_abstractions such as an injecting a constant reference to an object
implementing a service interface, or to_ +
_a managed collection of such objects. See the description of
osgi:reference in the Spring Dynamic_ +
_Modules specification for an example of the level of support required
here._ +
_Providing these capabilities on the OSGi platform will facilitate the
adoption of OSGi as a deployment platform for_ +
_enterprise applications. This should be done in a manner that is
familiar to enterprise Java developers, taking into_ +
_account the unique requirements of the OSGi platform. The benefits also
extend to other (non-enterprise) OSGi_ +
_applications that will gain the ability to write simpler, more testable
bundles backed by a strong component model._
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Create the file `persistence-osgi.xml` in the directory
`src/main/resources/META-INF/spring` and add the lines :

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:osgi="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi"
  xsi:schemaLocation="
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi.xsd">

    <osgi:service ref="incidentDAO" interface="org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.dao.IncidentDAO"/>

</beans>
----

The osgi:service namespace tells to Spring to register the interface
`org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.dao.IncidentDAO` as a service
in the OSGI registry. This feature proposed by Spring will be part of
the next OSGI specification
http://www.osgi.org/Download/File?url=/download/osgi-4.2-early-draft3.pdf[R4.2]
under the name of Blueprint - RFC 124.

Remark :

* Notice also that to use this osgi spring namespace, we have imported a
new schema `http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi.xsd`
in the persistence-osgi.xml file
* More than one interface can be part of an
http://static.springframework.org/osgi/docs/1.2.0/reference/html-single/#service-registry:export[OSGI
service].

Another feature that I would like to introduce here concerns the
http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v401/org/osgi/service/cm/package-summary.html[Configuration
Admin]. In its simplest form, the CM can be seen as a configuration
source, namely a Dictionary whose keys are always Strings. Spring DM can
expose entries in the CM as a Properties object, through the
cm-properties element.

So, we can adapt our `spring-datasource-beans.xml` file created in the
previous link:tutorial-osgi-camel-part2.html[chapter] with new xml tags
:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <context:property-placeholder properties-ref="preProps" />     (1)
    ...
    <osgix:cm-properties id="preProps" persistent-id="org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.datasource"> (2)
        <prop key="driverClassName">com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</prop>
        <prop key="url">jdbc:mysql:///report</prop>
        <prop key="username"></prop>
        <prop key="password"></prop>        
    </osgix:cm-properties>
    ...
    <bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close">
    <property name="driverClassName" value="${driverClassName}" /> (3)
    <property name="url" value="${url}" />
    <property name="username" value="${username}" />
    <property name="password" value="${password}" />
    </bean>
----

The configuration above, exposes the properties available in the CM
under `org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.datasource` entry (2) as
a bean named preProps. Moreover, the property declared (3) can be
override by creating a file named
`org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.datasource.cfg` and containing
the parameters :

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
url=jdbc:mysql:///report
username=root
password=
----

Spring using the `context:property-placeholder` (1) will be able to load
it.

Remarks :

* We will see in the chapter 'deployment' where this file must be
deployed.
* In our example, we have only defined `properties` for the `driver`,
`username` and \{\{password }} but you can extend the list of values
with by example Hibernate parameters like hibernate.show_sql,
hibernate.format_sql, ...

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part2a-Step3:reportincident.service]]
Step 3 : reportincident.service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like for the project reportincident.persistence, we will replace our
pom.xml file with the one provided in the zip file. As you can see in
the <Import-Package>, we will import here the class required by the
service : org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.dao

Adding this line in the Import-Package is not enough to have access to
the OSGI service. The file `spring-service-beans-dao.xml` must be
modified to have a reference to this interface through the
osgi:reference namespace :

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
...
    <property name="incidentDAO">
        <osgi:reference interface="org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.dao.IncidentDAO"/>
    </property>
...
----

This
http://static.springframework.org/osgi/docs/1.2.0/reference/html-single/#service-registry:refs[reference]
will be used to call the osgi service to find the service corresponding
to the interface name declared. If a match occurs, then a spring bean
reference is created in the bundle reportincident.service.

To expose our service as an OSGI service, we will create the file
`service-osgi.xml` in the directory `src/main/resources/META-INF/spring`
and add the code.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:osgi="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
                      http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi
                      http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi.xsd">

  <osgi:service ref="incidentService" interface="org.apache.camel.example.reportincident.service.IncidentService"/>
                
</beans>
----

Remark :

* Transaction Management has been defined in the corresponding files of
reportincident.persistence and reportincident.service but we will not
discuss them in detail in this tutorial.

[[tutorial-osgi-camel-part2a-Step4:reportincident.webservice]]
Step 4 : reportincident.webservice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This bundle will not be exported as an OSGI service. So, we only need to
modify the content of <Export-Package> to export the classes generated
by the wsl2java maven plugin and the wsdl file :

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
    <Export-Package>
    org.apache.camel.example.reportincident,
        '=META-INF.wsdl'
    </Export-Package>
----

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have transformed our current project in bundles, it is time
to design the routing and web parts of the application. In the next part
of the tutorial, we will specify modification to do for the new incoming
projects/bundles
