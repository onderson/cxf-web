How do I debug my route?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you've created a route and its not doing what you think it is you
could try using one of these features from link:download.html[version
1.4 onwards]

* link:tracer.html[Tracer] to trace in commons-logging / log4j each step
that Camel takes
* link:debugger.html[Debugger] to let you set breakpoints at points in
the route and examine historic message exchanges
* link:debugger.html[Debug] from your unit test if you use the Camel
`camel-test` component

Some link:user-stories.html[third party tools] offers Apache Camel route
debugging.
