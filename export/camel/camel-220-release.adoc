[[Camel2.2.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.2.0 release which approx 180 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip] now breaks when an exception
occurred
* link:mina.html[MINA] now supports easier configuration of multiple
custom codecs, which is needed when working with SSL.
* Improved link:transactionerrorhandler.html[TransactionErrorHandler]
two fold by reducing complexity of internal logic in Camel when working
with transactions. And added better support for using multiple
transactions in multiple routes. See more at section _Using multiple
routes with different propagation behaviors_ at
link:transactional-client.html[Transactional Client].
* link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] now supports
`parallelProcessing`, `stopOnException` and references for
`AggregationStrategy` and thread pools. This applies to the
`@RecipientList` annotation as well.
* Cleanup of spring jar dependencies.
* link:file-language.html[File Language] is now merged directly into
link:simple.html[Simple] language which among others makes
link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router] in Spring XML using
file language syntax easier.
* link:http.html[HTTP] is now using CamelContext Properties instead of
System Properties to set the http proxy configuration.
* Fixed link:using-camelproxy.html[Camel Proxy] throwing exception if
`null` was returned.
* Improved error handling with link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List]
and link:multicast.html[Multicast] which now performs redelivery etc. on
that _output_ node instead of starting again from the scratch.
* Improved the link:etl-example.html[ETL Example] and
link:bam-example.html[BAM Example] so they can be deployed into
ServiceMix4(Karaf).
* link:seda.html[SEDA] now supports `multipleConsumers` which allows you
to use it for pub-sub messaging where each consumer concurrently will
receive a copy of the link:exchange.html[Exchange]. This is done with
the help from link:multicast.html[Multicast] EIP.
* link:defaulterrorhandler.html[DefaultErrorHandler] will now log a log
line at `ERROR` level in case an Exception was thrown which could not be
redelivered either. This aid to see that an Exception occurred instead
of relying on the client logging it. You can customize this behavior on
the link:error-handler.html[Error Handler].
* Fixed `groupedExchange` not working properly on
link:aggregator.html[Aggregator].
* link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful Shutdown] which ensures Camel now
shutdown in a more reliable and graceful manner. This also works with in
memory components such as link:seda.html[SEDA].
* Added new `log` in the DSL for dynamic human readable log messages.
* Camel now supports Spring 3.0 as well (will still use Camel 2.5.6 as
default). However camel-spring-javaconfig now requires Spring 3.0 as
Spring have native support for java configuration.
* Added methods for getting header and property (Exchange / Message API)
which uses a default parameter.
* Added OsgiClassResolver which supports to load the class or resources
within OSGi platform.
* Added fireNow option to link:quartz.html[Quartz] component to fire the
trigger when the route is started.
* link:file2.html[File] will delete orphaned lock files on startup. This
allows it to selfheal in cases when Camel was terminated/killed
abruptly.
* Fixed issue with using Spring XML for routing could in some cases
_loose_ route scoped configured `<onException>`, `<onCompletion/>` when
using in combination with `<transacted/>`.
* `<proxy>`, `<export>`, `<endpoint>`, `<template>`,
`<consumerTemplate>` can be defined outside of `<camelContext>`.
* link:jaxb.html[JAXB] will filter the nonXml characters when it
unmarshals the inputstream or marshal the java object.
* Slightly reworked how correlation id is determined in
link:jms.html[JMS] when using InOut messaging. See more at _important
changes to consider when upgrading_.
* `EventNotifier` improved to allow ignoring events based on categories.
Easier configuration to only notify those events you care about.
* Added `PublishEventNotifier` to send the events to any kind of Camel
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint].
* link:jdbc.html[JDBC] added option
`useJDBC4ColumnNameAndLabelSemantics` to let you choose semantics to use
in case you have issue with your JDBC driver when using SQL SELECT with
aliases.
* link:cache.html[Cache] can now store message bodies which are
`Serializable` out of the box and not forcing to be converted into a
byte stream as it otherwise would.
* Fixed an issue with running the link:examples.html[Examples] using
ANT.
* `ManagementStrategy` now supports using multiple `EventNotifier`
instead of just one.
* Introduced link:notifybuilder.html[NotifyBuilder] which helps during
testing. For example when testing routes without mocks etc. It will help
to notify when a certain condition has occurred such as X messages has
is done etc.
* link:ftp2.html[FTP] now allows using starting directory with a dot in
the name. It used to invalidate those to easy transition from Camel 1.x
to 2.x as 1.x did also support using a file as starting (which was not
good practice).
* link:file2.html[File] producer now supports option to keep last
modified timestamp in case a message was received from some file source.
You can also set the timestamp it should use in the header
`Exchange.FILE_LAST_MODIFIED`.
* link:bean-language.html[Bean Language] using `bean` or `method` to
invoke a link:bean.html[Bean] now supports using an existing bean
instance. This is convenient for testing where you can quickly use an
instance you have prepared in the unit test.
* link:camel-jboss.html[camel-jboss] for running Camel inside JBoss
Application Server which uses it specialized classloading which prevents
typically frameworks to not work out of the box inside JBoss.
* http://camel-extra.googlecode.com/[Camel Extra] projects migrated to
use Camel 2.1.0 release.
* link:jaxb.html[JAXB] now supports partial marshalling/unmarshalling.
* link:bean.html[Bean] parameter binding using Camel annotations now
works with CGLIB enhanced classes.
* link:cxf.html[CXF] supports to configure the endpoint with CXF style
configuration.
* link:defaulterrorhandler.html[DefaultErrorHandler] will now log
stracktrace when an link:exchange.html[Exchange] is exhausted (give up).
Added new `logRetryStackTrace` option to set whether or not stacktraces
are logged for failed redelivery attempts. Most people dont like the
logs spammed if you retry 5 times etc.
* link:bean.html[Bean] component now honors void method invocations and
accepts methods returning `null` as a valid response.
* link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] now catches and handles all
exceptions (Throwable). This ensures fatal errors such as
`NoSuchMethodException` etc. will now be handle by Camel and logged etc.
* link:cxf.html[cxfbean] now propagates CONTENT_TYPE for other camel
component to use.

API breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[Camel2.2.0Release-DefaultComponent]]
DefaultComponent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The methods `DefaultComponent.resolveAndRemoveReferenceParameter` and
`DefaultComponent.resolveAndRemoveReferenceParameterList` have been
changed to make the leading `#` sign for bean references optional and to
throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if a referenced bean is not in the
registry. For details see
https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-2248[CAMEL-2248].

[[Camel2.2.0Release-Exchange]]
Exchange
^^^^^^^^

The property `Exchange.FILTETED` have been removed as part of
https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-2248[CAMEL-2288].

Added two new methods for `getProperty` to accept a `defaultValue` as
parameter to be used when the property does not exists.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-Message]]
Message
^^^^^^^

Added two new methods for `getHeader` to accept a `defaultValue` as
parameter to be used when the header does not exists.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-ExceptionHandler]]
ExceptionHandler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The class `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` now have two
additional methods which accepts more details when an Exception occurred
such as a message and the current Exchange.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-@EndpointInject]]
@EndpointInject
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `name` attribute in @EndpointInject has been renamed to `ref` to be
consistent with the other annotations. Its a reference for an Endpoint
to be looked up in the link:registry.html[Registry].

[[Camel2.2.0Release-BatchConsumer]]
BatchConsumer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `BatchConsumer` have a new method `isBatchAllowed` which should be
used during processing the batch, to break out the batch loop in case
its not allowed anymore. Also `BatchConsumer` should consider implement
`ShutdownAware` to support fine grained control during shutdown. See for
example the `GenericFileConsumer` for details.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-GenericFileProcessStrategy]]
GenericFileProcessStrategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `GenericFileProcessStrategy` has a new method `prepareOnStartup`
which is used to _prepare_ the link:file2.html[File] component on
startup, such as deleting orphaned lock files. The same applies for the
`GenericFileExclusiveReadLockStrategy` interface in case you have
developed a custom lock strategy.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-ManagementStrategy]]
ManagementStrategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `ManagementStrategy` now supports multiple `EventNotifier` and thus
have its setter/getter methods adjusted to a `List<EventNotifier>` and
there is a `addEventNotifier` method as well to add a single
`EventNotifier`.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-EventNotifier]]
EventNotifier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `EventNotifier` has new methods for filtering events based on
categories. The `DefaultEventNotifier` class has been renamed to
`LoggingEventNotifier` and a new `EventNotifierSupport` class is added
which is meant for custom implementations to extend.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-UnitOfWork]]
UnitOfWork
^^^^^^^^^^

The `UnitOfWork` have adjusted its methods for setting `RouteContext`
from a setter to a `push` and `pop` style.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

See known issues from previous releases.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-UsingRecipientListandMina]]
Using RecipientList and Mina
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using the link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] together with
link:mina.html[MINA] endpoints Camel will over time hold on to memory
which could lead to OutOfMemoryErrors. See more at:
https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-2484[CAMEL-2484]

[[Camel2.2.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[Camel2.2.0Release-Featuresfilemoved]]
Features file moved
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Camel 2.2.0, the newly named `features.xml` file can be found in
http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/camel/karaf/apache-camel/2.2.0/ +
You can use it in Karaf by doing a
*`features:addUrl mvn:org.apache.camel.karaf/apache-camel/2.2.0/xml/features`*

[[Camel2.2.0Release-Pleasedon'tinstallcamel-osgiandcamel-spring-osgibundleinOSGienvironmentatthesametime]]
Please don't install camel-osgi and camel-spring-osgi bundle in OSGi
environment at the same time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have an issue that installing camel-osgi and camel-spring in
different order will cause the "http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring"
namespace can't be handled rightly in OSGi environment. From Camel 2.2.0
we merged the camel-osgi and camel-spring bundles together, it's
camel-spring-osgi. +
In this way camel-osgi and camel-spring-osgi both have the
BundleActivator which helps camel-core to load the component in OSGi
container. If you install these two bundle at the same time will cause
some conflict on the component finding. +
You just need to install camel-core, camel-spring-osgi bundle to let the
basic camel application work.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-Springjardependencieshavebeencutdownincamel-core.]]
Spring jar dependencies have been cut down in camel-core.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `pom.xml` file for *camel-core* have cut down number of spring jar
dependencies to allow Camel to easily run without any Spring .jars at
all. However this affects you if you use maven and use camel-core
without camel-spring or spring at all. If you want to use JMX with Camel
then you need to add the following 4 spring jars required:
`spring-core.jar, spring-beans.jar, spring-context.jar, spring-aop.jar`.
With maven you only need to depend on `spring-context` and `spring-aop`
as they will bring in the other two jars.

See also link:camel-jar-dependencies.html[Camel JAR Dependencies] and
link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX].

[[Camel2.2.0Release-Usingfilterin]]
Using filter in link:splitter.html[Splitter]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `filter` no long influence the `split` and its `AggregationStrategy`
as it was just too confusing why it did that. See
https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-2248[CAMEL-2288] for
details.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-camel-httpandproxy]]
camel-http and proxy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The link:http.html[HTTP] component used to read Proxy settings directly
from system properties. You should instead configure proxy wide
information as properties to the `CamelContext` instead. See
link:http.html[HTTP] for details.

[[Camel2.2.0Release-camel-jms]]
camel-jms
^^^^^^^^^

How correlationId is determined has been changed slightly. Now
link:jms.html[JMS] will always use messageId if configured to do so
using `useMessageIDAsCorrelationID==true`. Otherwise `JMSCorrelationID`
is used but if that has not been set then Camel will fallback to use
`messageId` instead. See the method `determineCorrelationId` in the
class `org.apache.camel.component.jms.EndpointMessageListener` for
actual implementation. This change will most likely not affect most
users.
