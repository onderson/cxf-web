Using CamelProxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Camel allows you to proxy a producer sending to an
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint] by a regular interface. Then when clients
using this interface can work with it as if its regular java code but in
reality its proxied and does a link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] to
a given endpoint.

[[UsingCamelProxy-ProxyfromSpring]]
Proxy from Spring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define a proxy in the spring XML file as shown
below\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/config/AnotherCamelProxyTest.xml}Now
the client can grab this bean using regular spring bean coding and
invoke it as if its just another bean. +
The code is based on an unit test but proves the
point:\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/spring/config/AnotherCamelProxyTest.java}

[[UsingCamelProxy-ProxyfromJava]]
Proxy from Java
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also create a proxy from regular Java using a
`org.apache.camel.component.bean.ProxyHelper` as shown below:

Endpoint endpoint = context.getEndpoint("direct:start"); MyProxySender
sender = ProxyHelper.createProxy(endpoint, MyProxySender.class);

In *Camel 2.3* you can use `org.apache.camel.builder.ProxyBuilder` which
may be easier to use than
ProxyHelper:\{snippet:id=e4|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/bean/BeanProxyTest.java}

[[UsingCamelProxy-ProxywithAnnotation]]
Proxy with Annotation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another way to configure the proxy from java is by using the @Produce
annotation. Also see link:pojo-producing.html[POJO Producing].

@Produce(uri="direct:start") MyProxySender sender;

This basically does the same as ProxyHelper.createProxy.

[[UsingCamelProxy-WhatissendontheMessage]]
What is send on the Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using a proxy Camel will send the message payload as a
`org.apache.camel.component.bean.BeanInvocation` object (*Camel 2.15 or
older) which holds the details of which method was invoked and what the
argument was. From *Camel 2.16* onwards Camel parameter binding is
enabled by default, which will use binding information from the method
signature parameters to bind to the Exchange/Message with the following
annotations

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Annotation |Parameter Type |Parameter binds to
|@Body |Object |Binds the parameter to the message body

|@Header(name) |Object |Binds the parameter to the message header with
the given name

|@Headers |Map |Binds the parameter to the message headers. The
parameter is expected to be of `java.util.Map` type.

|@ExchangeProperty(name) |Object |Binds the parameter to the exchange
property with the given name
|=======================================================================

If a parameter does not have any annotation then the parameter is bound
to the message body.

For example given the following interface

public interface MyAuditService \{ void auditMessage(@Header("uuid")
String uuid, @Body String body); }

Then from Java DSL we can create a proxy and call the method

// must enable binding on proxy MyAuditService service = new
ProxyBuilder(context).endpoint("jms:queue:foo").build(MyAuditService.class);
service.auditMessage("1234", "Hello World");

Which will send the message to the JMS queue foo, with the
header(uuid)=1234 and body=Hello World. The message is sent as InOnly as
the method is void.

The old behavior can be enabled by setting binding off, such as:

// must enable binding on proxy MyAuditService service = new
ProxyBuilder(context).endpoint("jms:queue:foo").binding(false).build(MyAuditService.class);
service.auditMessage("1234", "Hello World");

[[UsingCamelProxy-TurningtheBeanInvocationintoafirstclasspayload]]
Turning the BeanInvocation into a first class payload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.1*

If you proxied method signature only have one parameter such as:

String hello(String name);

Then it gives another advantage in Camel as it allows Camel to regard
the value passed in to this single parameter as the _real_ payload. In
other words if you pass in `Camel` to the hello method, then Camel can
_see_ that as a `java.lang.String` payload with the value of `Camel`.
This gives you a great advantage as you can use the proxy as first class
services with Camel.

You can proxy Camel and let clients use the pure and clean interfaces as
if Camel newer existed. Then Camel can proxy the invocation and receive
the input passed into the single method parameter and regard that as if
it was _just_ the message payload.

From *Camel 2.16* onwards this is improved as binding is enabled out of
the box, where Camel binds to the message parameters using the
annotation listed in the table above. If a parameter has no annotation
then the parameter is bound to the message body.

 

Okay lets try that with an example

[[UsingCamelProxy-Examplewithproxyusingsingleparametermethods.]]
Example with proxy using single parameter methods.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At first we have the interface we wish to
proxy\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/bean/OrderService.java}Notice
that all methods have single parameters. The return type is optional, as
you can see one of them is void. +
Also what you should know is that Camel uses its
link:type-converter.html[Type Converter] mechanism to adapt to the types
defined on the methods.

This allows us to easily use `org.w3c.dom.Document` and `String` types
with no hazzle.

Okay then we have the following route where we route using a
link:content-based-router.html[Content Based Router] that is XML based.
See that we use link:xpath.html[XPath] in the choices to route the
message depending on its a book order or
not.\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/bean/BeanProxyTest.java}Now
there is a couple of tests that shows using the Camel Proxy how we can
easily invoke the proxy and do not know its actually Camel doing some
routing
underneath.\{snippet:id=e2|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/bean/BeanProxyTest.java}And
this one below shows using different types that Camel adapts
to.\{snippet:id=e3|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/bean/BeanProxyTest.java}Isn't
this cool?

[[UsingCamelProxy-AsynchronoususingFuture]]
Asynchronous using Future
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.8*

By default the link:using-camelproxy.html[Camel Proxy] invocation is
synchronous when invoked from the client. If you want this to be
asynchronous you define the return type to be of
`java.util.concurrent.Future` type. The `Future` is a handle to the task
which the client can use to obtain the result.

For example given this client
interface\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|title=Client
Interface|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/bean/ProxyReturnFutureTest.java}The
client can use this with a link:using-camelproxy.html[Camel Proxy] as
shown from the following snippet from an unit
test:\{snippet:id=e2|lang=java|title=Using
Client|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/bean/ProxyReturnFutureTest.java}This
allows you to fully define your client API without any Camel dependency
at all, and decide whether the invocation should be synchronous or
asynchronous.

If the Client is asynchronous (return type is Future) then Camel will
continue processing the invocation using a thread pool which is being
looked up using the key `CamelInvocationHandler`. Its a shared thread
pool for all link:using-camelproxy.html[Camel Proxy] in the
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext]. You can define a
link:threading-model.html[thread pool profile] with the id
`CamelInvocationHandler` to configure settings such as min/max threads
etc.
