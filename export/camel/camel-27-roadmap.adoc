Camel 2.7 roadmap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a roadmap which details the overall and major goals for Camel
2.7. Fell free to discuss this at the Camel
link:mailing-lists.html[Mailing Lists] if you have ideas or feedback. +
The goals on this page was intended to be introduced in
link:camel-30-ideas.html[Camel 3.0]. After discussing this on the
http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/DISCUSS-Dropping-support-for-java-1-5-from-camel-2-7-0-onwards-tp3354712p3354712.html[Developer
List] we decided to bring forward some of the goals for 3.0 to 2.7.
Those goals is listed on this page:

[[Camel2.7-Roadmap-JDK1.6+]]
JDK 1.6+
++++++++

Camel 2.7 should bump the JDK minimum version to 1.6. +
Camel 1.x - 2.6.0 supports JDK 1.5+.

*Status: Done*

[[Camel2.7-Roadmap-Spring3.x]]
Spring 3.x
++++++++++

Camel 2.7 should bump the minimum version of Spring to 3.0+. +
Camel 1.x - 2.6.0 supports Spring 2.0+

*Status: Done*

[[Camel2.7-Roadmap-Logging]]
Logging
+++++++

We should switch from `commons-logging` to `slf4j`

*Status: Done*

[[Camel2.7-Roadmap-JUnit]]
JUnit
+++++

Use JUnit 4.x by default. However JUnit 4.x is backwards compatible with
JUnit 3.x. The change would be to remove the JUnit 3.x support in
`camel-test` JAR if that's desirable.

*Status: Done*

[[Camel2.7-Roadmap-camel-osgi-test]]
camel-osgi-test
+++++++++++++++

When testing your Camel apps with OSGi you may use PaxExam for that. We
should create a test kit for osgi, like we have camel-test for regular
junit testing. The test kit should make it easy for end users to have
their apps tested with OSGi. We already have pieces in the
`tests/camel-itest-osgi`. We just need to clean and shape it up so its
ready for end users as well. And of course add documentation as well. +
And then we should use it in `camel-itest-osgi` of course.

*Status: Postponed*

[[Camel2.7-Roadmap-Improveunittesting]]
Improve unit testing
++++++++++++++++++++

It should be easier to mock endpoints, replace parts of routes and
whatnot. This allows you to leave your routes untouched and use the test
kit to perform unit testing your routes. Currently the easiest approach
is to add mocks into your routes which isn't desirable in some
situations. Instead you should be able to _tell_ Camel which endpoints
should be mocked and what parts of the routes should be replaced with an
alternative part. This is an ongoing process which we hope to improve in
future releases as well.

*Status: Done*
