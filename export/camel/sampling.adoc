Sampling Throttler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel 2.1*

A sampling throttler allows you to extract a sample of the exchanges
from the traffic through a route. +
It is configured with a sampling period during which only a single
exchange is allowed to pass through. All other exchanges will be
stopped.

Will by default use a sample period of 1 seconds.

Samples
^^^^^^^

You use this EIP with the `sample` DSL as show in these samples.

*Using the link:fluent-builders.html[Fluent Builders]* +
These samples also show how you can use the different syntax to
configure the sampling period:

\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/processor/SamplingThrottlerTest.java}

*Using the link:spring-xml-extensions.html[Spring XML Extensions]* +
And the same example in Spring XML is:

\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/samplingThrottler.xml}

And since it uses a default of 1 second you can omit this configuration
in case you also want to use 1 second

\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/processor/samplingThrottlerWithDefault.xml}
