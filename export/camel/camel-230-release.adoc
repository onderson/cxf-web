[[Camel2.3.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.3.0 release which approx 276 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* link:threading-model.html[Overhauled threading model] and introducing
`threadPoolProfile` to define profiles for thread pools to have easy
configuration.
* link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Property placeholders] in for
example endpoint uris is not natively supported in *camel-core* which
means you no long need to use Spring for that. It works therefore in any
environment as its provided out of the box in camel-core.
* link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Property placeholders] also works
in the `<CamelContext>` when using Spring XML. Basically nearly all
places where you enter text the property placeholder is supported.
* Total overhaul of the link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] EIP, which now
has better completion triggers, and supports pluggable repository. For
example to use link:hawtdb.html[camel-hawtdb] as persistent store. Also
added support for recovery and transactional behavior when using
link:hawtdb.html[camel-hawtdb].
* Added `ExchangeSentEvent` to `EventNotifier` which contains time taken
and is emitted when an link:exchange.html[Exchange] is sent to an
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint]. This allows end users to easily gather
performance stats for link:exchange.html[Exchange] send to endpoints.
* Added `disconnect` option to link:mina.html[MINA] to close Mina
session right after usage.
* link:jetty.html[Jetty] now supports to get the `HttpServletRequest`
and `HttpServletResponse` from the link:message.html[Message] header.
* link:xpath.html[XPathBuilder] now supports being used without an
link:exchange.html[Exchange] which allows you to use it in a
custom/generic fashion.
* link:xpath.html[XPath] now supports using the JVM system property
specifying a custom `XPathFactory` to be used. You can use this to
switch from default to use e.g. Saxon.
* link:xslt.html[XSLT] now supports using `<xsl:include>` where the
files is loaded from classpath, and being able to load relative
according to the endpoint configured location. See the wiki page for
details.
* link:file2.html[File], link:ftp2.html[FTP] added option
`eagerDeleteTargetFile` to control the behavior when using `tempFile`
whether or not to eagerly delete the target file or wait until last
moment.
* Reduced registering producers in JMX to prevent using too much memory
and potentially registering short lived producers which didn't bring
much value of being managed as well.
* Added link:http.html[camel-http4] component using Apache HTTP Client
4.0.1. This can be used by early adaptors to try out the new Apache HTTP
Client 4.x architecture.
* Upgraded link:jetty.html[Jetty] to use Jetty 7.0.1.
* Individual routes can be link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful
Shutdown] at runtime, which allows you to stop the route in a more
reliable and gentle way.
* Added `removeHeaders` to remove multiple headers, e.g. use
`removeHeaders("Camel*")` to remove all Camel related headers.
* Improved the link:load-balancer.html[Failover load balancer] to
support round robin mode and a few other options as well.
* Fixed issue with Camel not being able to run deployed as a WAR in
WebLogic server.
* Fixed link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer] not working with
link:jms.html[JMS] selector.
* link:content-enricher.html[pollEnrich] now handover completions which
means you can use the `move` like options from link:file2.html[File or
FTP] component. For example to enrich with a file and have that file
moved when the route completes.
* Added @Attachments annotation to Bean binding.
* link:simple.html[Simple] and link:bean.html[Bean] language now has a
build in OGNL notation which allows you to reference from `Map` or
`List` structures and as well to invoke methods in a OGNL like notation.
See more details at link:simple.html[Simple] wiki page.
* link:jetty.html[camel-jetty] supports the multipart/form post out of
box.
* link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful Shutdown] now shut down routes in
the reverse order in which they was started. Option
`shutdownRoutesInReverseOrder` can be used to control this behavior.
* link:xslt.html[XSLT] component now allows you to chose which output
type to use with the `output` option. For example you can now stream
directly to a file, for example when transforming very big xml messages.
* link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] can be configure with
specialized <errorHandler/> tag to make it easier to configure error
handling in Spring XML.
* Added `depends-on` attribute to `<camelContext/>` so you can have
other beans created before Camel when using Spring XML.
* Added `org.apache.camel.builder.ProxyBuilder` to easier create
link:using-camelproxy.html[Camel Proxy] in Java / Java DSL.
* `ProducerTemplate` and `ConsumerTemplate` can now be configured with a
`maximumCacheSize` to control how many producers/consumers they can
cache.
* Methods on `CamelContext} to create {{ProducerTemplate` and
`ConsumerTemplate` now pre starts the templates so they are ready to use
asap.
* Fixed polling link:file2.html[File]s on a Windows network share may
skip files with a log message `Ignoring unsupported file type for file`.
* `ProducerCache` is now exposed for management in JMX which allows you
to 'keep an eye on it' at runtime. This cache is used by certain EIP
patterns.
* Fixed polling link:file2.html[File]s or link:ftp2.html[FTP]s when
recursive and idempotent is enabled, which could cause Camel to not
pickup files in sibling folders with similar name to already consumed
files.
* Improved request/reply messaging over link:seda.html[SEDA] and
link:vm.html[VM] endpoints to work properly with many endpoints
(chained).
* link:jpa.html[JPA] component will now auto lookup
`EntityManagerFactory` and `TransactionManager` from
link:registry.html[Registry] to support convention over configuration.
Then you do not any longer need to explicit configure this on the
`JpaComoponent`. If auto lookup failed a `WARN` log is logged.
* Fixed camel-spring having factory beans for `ProducerTemplate` and
`ConsumerTemplate` set to non singleton, which caused it to create new
instances. Obviously it should have been singleton as you want to reuse
the template.
* Fixed camel-spring when @Produce/@Consume/@EndpointInjected annotated
was used on prototype scoped beans, to *not* register those annotated
services to be closed in `CamelContext`. This caused Camel to keep
references to these services even when the prototype was no longer in
used. And causing Camel to eat memory.
* Added link:spring-security.html[camel-spring-security] component, now
you can use
http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/index.html[spring
security] within camel route.
* link:mock.html[Mock] endpoints now report more detailed assertion
failures when binary predicates are used, as you can see the evaluated
expression which failed.
* Improved the link:tracer.html[Tracer] to make it easier for Camel end
users to extend it and use custom tracing such as storing to a database
using link:jpa.html[JPA] but with their own `@Entity` class.
* Improved link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] when sending a new
link:exchange.html[Exchange] by having access to the original
link:exchange.html[Exchange] so you can grab that information when
creating the new link:exchange.html[Exchange].
* Fixed `Policy` to be applicable per processor, multiple processors or
the entire route
* Camel now checks more aggressively on startup if route nodes which
mandates child nodes also have such configured. If not an exception will
be thrown on startup.
* link:xpath.html[XPath] is now easier to work with as we added more
type converters which supports the default type, `org.w3c.dom.NodeList`,
use by link:xpath.html[XPath].
* When using Spring XML you can now
link:how-do-i-import-routes-from-other-xml-files.html[import routes from
other XML files]
* Much
link:how-do-i-specify-time-period-in-a-human-friendly-syntax.html[friendlier
syntax] to configure time periods in endpoint uris, for example the
link:timer.html[Timer] component. Or how often to poll from a
link:file2.html[File] or link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumer.
* link:http.html[Camel Http component] will not consumer the message
body when it parses the POST message with the content-type of
"application/x-www-form-urlencoded", and it also honors the charset
setting of the "content-type".
* Now you can enable or disable gzip processing by setting the exchange
property with name Exchange.SKIP_GZIP_ENCODING and value Boolean.True in
link:http.html[Camel Http component].
* Improved `NodeList` to `String` converter to include xml tags,
attributes and whatnot, eg you get outputs such as
`<foo id="123">bar<year>2010</year></foo>`.
* Added `continued` option to link:exception-clause.html[Exception
Clause] so you can use it catch the exception and *continue* routing
from the point of where the exception was thrown (Camel will continue to
the next processor in the route graph).
* link:recipient-list.html[Recipient List] and
link:routing-slip.html[Routing Slip] now has option
`ignoreInvalidEndpoints` to just ignore and continue if an endpoint uri
was invalid.
* Now you can override the default XSL output properties by
https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-2720[setting the
CamelContext properties]
* Now camel provides a karaf feature file with Spring 3.0.2.RELEASE, the
features url is
"mvn:org.apache.camel.karaf/apache-camel/2.3.0/xml/features-spring3"

[[Camel2.3.0Release-APIbreaking]]
API breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The link:aggregator2.html[Aggregate] has been overhauled and thus you
need to migrate you Camel application if you use it. +
See the link:aggregator2.html[Aggregate] wiki page for which options it
has you should use.

In link:mina.html[MINA] the header key
`MinaConsumer.HEADER_CLOSE_SESSION_WHEN_COMPLETE` is moved to
`MinaConstants.MINA_CLOSE_SESSION_WHEN_COMPLETE`

`org.apache.camel.spi.PollingConsumerPollStrategy` now returns a boolean
in the `begin` method. Use `true` to accept to begin polling, and
`false` to skip polling at this time.

A new method `onInit` has been added to
`org.apache.camel.spi.RoutePolicy`.

Added method `removeHeaders` on the `org.apache.camel.Message` API.

`getExecutorService/setExecutorService` have been removed from
`DefaultComponent` and `DefaultEndpoint`. +
You should use `CamelContext.getExecutorServiceStrategy()` which is the
API for creating thread pools in Camel.

Changed `Exception` to `Throwable` on the
`org.apache.camel.spi.EventFactory` and the various `xxxEvent` objects
as Camel now catches `Throwable` on shutdown to ensure a more robust
shutdown in case a `Throwable` was thrown.

Removed unused class `org.apache.camel.spi.Provider`.

Fixed spelling in the `parallelProcessing` option from the
`@RecipientList` annotation.

`GenericFile` is no longer `java.io.Serializable`

Method `adviceWith` on `RouteDefinition` now requires `CamelContext` as
first parameter.

[[Camel2.3.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The link:tracer.html[Tracer] may not output all details for some
situations such as when using `onCompletion` or `intercept` etc.

Not all link:examples.html[Examples] have ANT build.xml files to run the
example using ANT.

If using link:quartz.html[camel-quartz] in OSGi it may stop the
scheduler if you update bundles with Camel applications using
link:quartz.html[Quartz] endpoints. +
See more details at this
http://fusesource.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=1733&tstart=0[discussion].

There is a potential dead lock in the link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator]
when using timeout condition. See more at
https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-2824[CAMEL-2824].

The link:error-handler.html[LoggingErrorHandler] does not work when also
using link:exception-clause.html[onException]. It may go into an endless
loop. So refrain from using logging error handler.

There is a concurrency issue when using predicates using binary
operators such as `isEqualTo`. See
https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/CAMEL-3188[CAMEL-3188].

link:hawtdb.html[HawtDB] does not work in OSGi

link:hawtdb.html[HawtDB] has a bug in version 1.4 or older which
prevents the filestore to free unused space. Version 1.5 fixes this.

[[Camel2.3.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] has been overhauled and thus you
need to migrate you Camel application if you use it. +
See the link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] wiki page for which options it
has you should use.

The link:toasync.html[ToAsync] feature has been *@deprecated*. It will
be replaced by a better asynchronous routing engine in the next Camel
release.

The link:seda.html[SEDA] endpoint is now by default unbounded in size,
where as before they had a default size of 1000.

link:jetty.html[camel-jetty] has been upgraded to use Jetty 7.0.1 from
6.1.22. These two versions is much different as 7.x is moved to be
hosted at Eclipse, which means all it package names has been renamed.

In link:http.html[camel-http] some options in relation to authentication
has been renamed to avoid clashing with using `username` and `password`
as uri parameters, which can be common names to be used. Therefore if
you have configured authentication on the link:http.html[HTTP] endpoint
you have to rename those options, and as well a authentication method
(`authMethod`) must be provided as well (BASIC, DIGEST, NTML).

Camel will now shutdown routes in reverse order in which they where
started.

The outbound Exchange from link:splitter.html[Splitter] will now by
default use the original link:exchange.html[Exchange] (input to
Splitter). To use the old behavior you can configure the
link:splitter.html[Splitter] to use `UseLatestAggregationStrategy`.

The camel-cxf component PAYLOAD mode has been improved to delegate all
SOAP message parsing to CXF. The camel-cxf component now requires CXF
2.2.8 or newer.

XPath or working with XML. Camel now converters `NodeList` to `String` a
bit differently as it now outputs the String including the XML tags,
childtags, attributes etc. If using XPath you can use the `text()`
function to grab only the text content.

The default charset which is used in camel converters can be set by
using the System property with the key
`org.apache.camel.default.charset`, if not set it will fallback to use
`UTF-8` by default.
