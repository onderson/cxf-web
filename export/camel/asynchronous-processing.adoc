Overview
^^^^^^^^

[Info]
====
 **Supported versions**

The information on this page applies for *Camel 2.4* or later.

Before *Camel 2.4* the asynchronous processing is only implemented for
link:jbi.html[JBI] where as in *Camel 2.4* we have implemented it in
many other areas. See more at
link:asynchronous-routing-engine.html[Asynchronous Routing Engine].

====

Camel supports a more complex asynchronous processing model. The
asynchronous processors implement the
*`org.apache.camel.AsyncProcessor`* interface which is derived from the
more synchronous *`org.apache.camel.Processor`* interface. There are
advantages and disadvantages when using asynchronous processing when
compared to using the standard synchronous processing model.

*Advantages*:

* Processing routes that are composed fully of asynchronous processors
do not use up threads waiting for processors to complete on blocking
calls. This can increase the scalability of your system by reducing the
number of threads needed to process the same workload.
* Processing routes can be broken up into link:seda.html[SEDA]
processing stages where different thread pools can process the different
stages. This means that your routes can be processed concurrently.

*Disadvantages*:

* Implementing asynchronous processors is more complex than implementing
the synchronous versions.

[[AsynchronousProcessing-WhentoUse]]
When to Use
^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend that processors and components be implemented the more
simple synchronous APIs unless you identify a performance of scalability
requirement that dictates otherwise. A Processor whose *`process()`*
method blocks for a long time would be good candidates for being
converted into an asynchronous processor.

[[AsynchronousProcessing-InterfaceDetails]]
Interface Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
public interface AsyncProcessor extends Processor {
   boolean process(Exchange exchange, AsyncCallback callback);
}
----

The *`AsyncProcessor`* defines a single *`process()`* method which is
very similar to it's synchronous *`Processor.process()`* brethren.

Here are the differences:

* A non-null *`AsyncCallback`* *MUST* be supplied which will be notified
when the exchange processing is completed.
* It *MUST* not throw any exceptions that occurred while processing the
exchange. Any such exceptions must be stored on the
exchange's *`Exception`* property.
* It *MUST* know if it will complete the processing synchronously or
asynchronously. The method will return *`true`* if it does complete
synchronously, otherwise it returns *`false`*.
* When the processor has completed processing the exchange, it must call
the *`callback.done(boolean sync)`* method.
* The sync parameter *MUST* match the value returned by the
*`process()`* method.

[[AsynchronousProcessing-ImplementingProcessorsthatUsetheAsyncProcessorAPI]]
Implementing Processors that Use the AsyncProcessor API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All processors, even synchronous processors that do not implement
the *`AsyncProcessor`* interface, can be coerced to implement
the *`AsyncProcessor`* interface. This is usually done when you are
implementing a Camel component consumer that supports asynchronous
completion of the exchanges that it is pushing through the Camel routes.
Consumers are provided a *`Processor`* object when created. All
Processor object can be coerced to a *`AsyncProcessor`* using the
following API:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
Processor processor = ...
AsyncProcessor asyncProcessor = AsyncProcessorTypeConverter.convert(processor);
----

For a route to be fully asynchronous and reap the benefits to lower
Thread usage, it must start with the consumer implementation making use
of the asynchronous processing API. If it called the
synchronous *`process()`* method instead, the consumer's thread would be
forced to be blocked and in use for the duration that it takes to
process the exchange.

It is important to take note that just because you call the asynchronous
API, it does not mean that the processing will take place
asynchronously. It only allows the possibility that it can be done
without tying up the caller's thread. If the processing happens
asynchronously is dependent on the configuration of the Camel route.

Normally, the the process call is passed in an inline
inner *`AsyncCallback`* class instance which can reference the exchange
object that was declared final. This allows it to finish up any post
processing that is needed when the called processor is done processing
the exchange.

Example.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
final Exchange exchange = ...
AsyncProcessor asyncProcessor = ...
asyncProcessor.process(exchange, new AsyncCallback() {
    public void done(boolean sync) {

        if (exchange.isFailed()) {
            ... // do failure processing.. perhaps rollback etc.
        } else {
            ... // processing completed successfully, finish up 
                // perhaps commit etc.
        }
    }
});
----

[[AsynchronousProcessing-AsynchronousRouteSequenceScenarios]]
Asynchronous Route Sequence Scenarios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that we have understood the interface contract of the
*`AsyncProcessor`*, and have seen how to make use of it when calling
processors, let's looks a what the thread model/sequence scenarios will
look like for some sample routes.

The Jetty component's consumers support asynchronous processing through
the use of continuations. Suffice to say it can take a HTTP request and
pass it to a Camel route for asynchronous processing. If the processing
is indeed asynchronous, it uses a Jetty continuation so that the HTTP
request is 'parked' and the thread is released. Once the Camel route
finishes processing the request, the Jetty component uses
the *`AsyncCallback`* to tell Jetty to 'un-park' the request. Jetty
un-parks the request, the HTTP response returned using the result of the
exchange processing.

Notice that the jetty continuations feature is only used "If the
processing is indeed async". This is why *`AsyncProcessor.process()`*
implementations _must_ accurately report if request is completed
synchronously or not.

The *`jhc`* component's producer allows you to make HTTP requests and
implement the *`AsyncProcessor`* interface. A route that uses both the
jetty asynchronous consumer and the *`jhc`* asynchronous producer will
be a fully asynchronous route and has some nice attributes that can be
seen if we take a look at a sequence diagram of the processing route.

For the route:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("jetty:http://localhost:8080/service")
    .to("jhc:http://localhost/service-impl");
----

The sequence diagram would look something like this:

image:asynchronous-processing.data/simple-async-route.png[image]

The diagram simplifies things by making it looks like processors
implement the *`AsyncCallback`* interface when in reality
the *`AsyncCallback`* interfaces are inline inner classes, but it
illustrates the processing flow and shows how two separate threads are
used to complete the processing of the original HTTP request. The first
thread is synchronous up until processing hits the *`jhc`* producer
which issues the HTTP request. It then reports that the exchange
processing will complete asynchronously using NIO to get the response
back. Once the *`jhc`* component has received a full response it uses
*`AsyncCallback.done()`* method to notify the caller. These callback
notifications continue up until it reaches the original Jetty consumer
which then un-parks the HTTP request and completes it by providing the
response.

[[AsynchronousProcessing-MixingSynchronousandAsynchronousProcessors]]
Mixing Synchronous and Asynchronous Processors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is totally possible and reasonable to mix the use of synchronous and
asynchronous processors/components. The pipeline processor is the
backbone of a Camel processing route. It glues all the processing steps
together. It is implemented as an *`AsyncProcessor`* and supports
interleaving synchronous and asynchronous processors as the processing
steps in the pipeline.

Let's say we have two custom asynchronous processors,
namely: *`MyValidator`* and *`MyTransformation`*. Let's say we want to
load file from the data/in directory validate them with
the *`MyValidator()`* processor, transform them into JPA Java objects
using *`MyTransformation`* and then insert them into the database using
the link:jpa.html[JPA] component. Let's say that the transformation
process takes quite a bit of time and we want to allocate *`20`* threads
to do parallel transformations of the input files. The solution is to
make use of the thread processor. The thread is *`AsyncProcessor`* that
forces subsequent processing in asynchronous thread from a thread pool.

The route might look like:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("file:data/in")
  .process(new MyValidator())
  .threads(20)
  .process(new MyTransformation())
  .to("jpa:PurchaseOrder");
----

The sequence diagram would look something like this:

image:asynchronous-processing.data/camel-mixed-processors.png[image]

You would actually have multiple threads executing the second part of
the thread sequence.

[[AsynchronousProcessing-StayingSynchronousinanAsyncProcessor]]
Staying Synchronous in an `AsyncProcessor`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generally speaking you get better throughput processing when you process
things synchronously. This is due to the fact that starting up an
asynchronous thread and doing a context switch to it adds a little bit
of of overhead. So it is generally encouraged that *`AsyncProcessor`*'s
do as much work as they can synchronously. When they get to a step that
would block for a long time, at that point they should return from the
process call and let the caller know that it will be completing the call
asynchronously.
