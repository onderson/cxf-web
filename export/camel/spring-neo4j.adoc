Spring Neo4j Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available as of Camel Extra 2.11*

The *camel-spring-neo4j* library is provided by the
http://code.google.com/p/camel-extra/[Camel Extra] project which hosts
*GPL related components for Camel.

The *neo4j:* component allows you to treat Neo4j as a camel producer
endpoint. This means you can use this component in to() calls but not
from() calls. This component is backed by the
http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j
Library].

* As a producer, can create or remove nodes, and create or remove
relationships.
* Can support as many endpoints as required, eg for multiple databases
across multiple instances.
* Headers set for node id (for created nodes), relationship id (for
created relationships)

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
for this component:

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-spring-neo4j</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>

[[SpringNeo4j-URIformat]]
URI format
^^^^^^^^^^

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
spring-neo4j:http://hostname[:port]/database?options
----

Where the URL is the location of the of running neo4j rest server.

[[SpringNeo4j-Headers]]
Headers
^^^^^^^

The following headers are set on exchanges during message transport.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Value
|`Neo4jOperation` |One of the Neo4jOperation enum values `CREATE_NODE,
REMOVE_NODE, CREATE_RELATIONSHIP, REMOVE_RELATIONSHIP` which determines
which action to perform

|`Neo4jNodeId` |the id of the created node

|`Neo4jRelationshipId` |the id of the created relationship
|=======================================================================

The producer will set the headers for downstream processors once the
operation has taken place. Any ID headers set prior to the producer are
ignored.

[[SpringNeo4j-Operations]]
Operations
^^^^^^^^^^

The neo4j component looks for the Neo4jOperation header to determine
what kind of entity to create, which is one of the following enum types

`CREATE_NODE, REMOVE_NODE, CREATE_RELATIONSHIP, REMOVE_RELATIONSHIP`

The body of the message is used to determine the node or relationship to
manipulate. The following body types are supported:

For CREATE_NODE:

* null body - create default node
* Map body - create node with the properties set from the map

For REMOVE_NODE:

* Long or Integer - remove node using the body as the id
* neo4j Node instance - remove the node specified by that instance

For CREATE_RELATIONSHIP:

* SpringDataRelationship - create relationship specified by any
@NodeEntity annoted Spring entities.
* org.apache.camel.component.neo4j.BasicRelationship - create
relationship specified by the neo4j node types

For REMOVE_RELATIONSHIP:

* Long or Integer - remove relationship using the body as the id
* SpringDataRelationship - remove relationship specified by the
@NodeEntity annoted Spring entities.
* org.apache.camel.component.neo4j.BasicRelationship - remove
relationship specified by the neo4j node types

[[SpringNeo4j-Samples]]
Samples
^^^^^^^

If you wanted to insert a new empty node every 1 seconds

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("timer://foo?period=1000").to("spring-neo4j:http://localhost:7474/data")
----

If you wanted to delete a specific node specified by a filename, eg a
file of 100 would delete node 100.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
from("file:/var/data").process(new Processor() {
    @Override
    public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
        exchange.getIn().setBody(exchange.getIn().getHeader("CamelFileName"));
    }
}).to("spring-neo4j:http://localhost:7474/data")
