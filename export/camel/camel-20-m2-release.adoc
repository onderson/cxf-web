[[Camel2.0-M2Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.0-M2 release which approx 222 issues resolved (new
features, improvements and bug fixes such as...)

* Introduced link:type-converter.html[type converter registry] to allow
end users to programmatic get access to this registry
* major improvements to link:jetty.html[Jetty] for better handling of
exception/faults and easier end-user customization how response should
be written
* major improvements to link:file2.html[File] for consuming files, now
supporting pluggable sorting, filtering and idempotent repositories.
* major refactor and improvements to link:ftp2.html[FTP], aligning it
with the link:file2.html[File] component.
* minor improvements to link:jdbc.html[JDBC], link:sql.html[SQL],
link:http.html[Http] and link:mina.html[Mina]
* major refactor and improvements to link:cxf.html[CXF] component.Â 
CxfBinding, HeaderFilterStrategy, Bus can be looked up from registry and
configured at the endpoint level.
* link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] producers added option
to write files using a temporary name and then rename it to the real
name after the write completes
* link:ftp.html[SFTP] added support for knownhosts and privatekey files
* link:mail.html[Mail] now supports setting additional SUN java mail
properties
* link:mina.html[Mina] now supports setting text line delimiters for
textline codec.
* link:mina.html[Mina] producer now throws CamelExchangeException in
case no response received from remote server when in sync mode
(sync=true)
* RedeliveryPolicy added support for ref attribute to reference a
existing policy in the link:registry.html[Registry]
* link:dead-letter-channel.html[RedeliveryPolicy] added `delayPattern`
option for using a special pattern for setting different delay based on
intervals
* Added `onWhen` and `retryUntil` predicates to
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause]
* link:list.html[List] component renamed to link:browse.html[Browse]
* link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] is much smarter as it
will use caused by exception hierarchy for matching as well (will use
bottom ups)
* link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] and
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause] now have `onRedeliver` to
allow custom processing an link:exchange.html[Exchange] *before* its
being redelivered. Allowing you to work on the message being sent.
* Added support for link:how-do-i-configure-endpoints.html[# syntax in
Endpoint URI's] to allow endpoint URI's to refer to bean in the
link:registry.html[Registry].
* `consumer.` prefix can be omitted for scheduled polling consumers such
as link:file2.html[File], link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumers. Thus the URI
options is more simpler and you don't have to remember which requires
`consumer.` prefix and which doesn't.
* link:tracer.html[Tracer] improved to allow custom routing and
processing of TraceEventMessage so you can store trace logs as you like,
for instance in a database.
* link:tracer.html[Tracer] now also displays the previous node so you
can see where the Exchange is coming from.
* link:quartz.html[Quartz] has added support for stateful jobs.
* Introduced @FallbackConverter for using annotation based fallback type
converters
* Extended link:content-enricher.html[content enrichment] support via
the link:content-enricher.html[enrich] DSL element.
* link:simple.html[Simple] language now supports a basic set of
operators.
* link:aggregator.html[Aggregator] now supports grouped exchanges out of
the box, so you can combine all aggregated exchanges into a single
grouped exchange going out.
* Multiple inputs can be define as input to routes:
`from("activemq:queue:order", "file://order").to("bean:handleOrder");`
* CXF component supports a new "cxfbean" endpoint that allows RESTful
requests to be routed to JAXRS annotated service beans.
* Setting cron expression in camel-quartz improved.
* Better handling of interrupts while shutting down.
* The JMSReplyTo destination is available as Exchange property when
consuming JMS messages.
* Better support for `InOptionalOut` Message Exchange Pattern.
* link:pluggable-class-resolvers.html[Pluggable Class Resolvers] SPI for
class resolvers allowing third party platforms such as JBoss to provide
integration with Camel.
* Refined API to reduce package tangling.
* Introduced wireTap node for the link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] EIP
pattern, supporting the traditional tapping and sending a new message.
* Added `fromF` and `toF` in the Java DSL to build uri strings using
String.format with arguments, e.g.:
`fromF("ftp://%s@myserver?password=%s", user, password)..to`
* Improved tooling being able to retrieve more runtime information from
the `CamelContext`
* Scala DSL is improved
* Added `JmsMessageType` option to link:jms.html[JMS] to allow you to
set which `javax.jms.Message` implementation to use for sending a JMS
message.
* Fixed a rare bug when JMX is disabled, a
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] could mistakenly be
added to some routes, when a global `noErrorHandler` was configured.
* link:jms.html[JMS] is now able to preserve hyphen in JMS keys (eg
Content-Type can be sent as a Message header). Introduced pluggable
strategy to allow end users to use their custom key formatter for
encode/decode.
* Added option `transferExchange` to link:jms.html[JMS] so you can
transfer the link:exchange.html[Exchange] over the wire. Can be used to
use JMS queues for link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] to
preserve all information from the failed link:exchange.html[Exchange]
including the original exception with stack trace.
* Added option `transferException` to link:jms.html[JMS] so when using
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] messaging with JMS, any caused
exception on the server side will be returned as response to the client.
* Added `rollback` as DSL keyword to force a rollback of the given
link:exchange.html[Exchange]. Does this by throwing an
`org.apache.camel.RollbackExchangeException`.
* Added SOAP Message Header filtering capability in camel-cxf component.
* ProducerTeamplate API reworked for sendBody operations to return void,
as they are InOnly. Use requestBody if you need InOut.
* Introduced `ConsumerTemplate` supporting the
link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer] EIP
* Custom endpoints with Spring @ManagedResource is now also registered
in the mbean server.
* The default error handler is changed from
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] to
link:defaulterrorhandler.html[DefaultErrorHandler].
* link:http.html[HTTP] component added option `throwException` that can
be disabled to allow failed response codes to be returned without
throwing a HttpOperationsFailedException.
* Overhaul and improvements to the link:try-catch-finally.html[Try Catch
Finally] DSLs, so they are on pair with the
link:exception-clause.html[Exception Clause].
* Overhaul and improvements to the link:intercept.html[Intercept] DSLs.
Added new `interceptSendToEndpoint` to intercept sending to a given
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint].
* Added the notion of a Channel in the routes.
* Added support to navigate the routes at runtime, so you can dynamic
change or affect the processors in the routes.
* Introduced a new link:async.html[Async] API for asynchronous
messaging.
* link:jetty.html[Jetty] now supports configuring Handler for e.g.
security.
* link:ibatis.html[iBatis] added option to set `StatementType` for fine
grained control of which SqlMapClient operation to invoke. Allowing
link:ibatis.html[iBatis] component to be used like link:sql.html[Sql] or
the link:jdbc.html[Jdbc] component.
* Added link:oncompletion.html[OnCompletion] callback to
link:exchange.html[Exchange] so you can do custom routing when an
link:exchange.html[Exchange] is completed. You can for instance use it
to send an email if an link:exchange.html[Exchange] failed.
* Added link:load-balancer.html[Failover] as load balancer.
* Added `throwException` to the DSL.
* Added link:bean-binding.html[@Handler] annotation to mark a method to
be invoked when using link:bean-integration.html[POJO] in routes.
* link:predicate.html[Predicate] uses type coercion for improving
matching, thus allowing you for instance to compare a String with an
Integer, "true" with a boolean, or enum type as string etc.
* Started to standardize consumers that supported batching as a
link:batch-consumer.html[Batch Consumer].
* link:servicepool.html[Connection pooling] for link:ftp2.html[FTP] and
link:mina.html[Mina] producers. This allows thread safe concurrency
usage of these components out of the box. The connection pooling is
pluggable so you can use a 3rd party pool framework.
* Added option `existFile` to link:file2.html[File] and
link:ftp2.html[FTP] component. This option allows you to configure what
should happen when you write a file and an existing file with that name
already exists. The link:file2.html[File] producer will now by default
*Override* existing files. In Camel 1.x it would default append.
* link:seda.html[Seda] and link:vm.html[Vm] now supports
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] and waiting for the reply if one
expected.
* Fixed issue with using 3rd party annotations and Camel annotations in
same POJO class. Now all annotations is processed by Spring.
* Added http://xircles.codehaus.org/projects/jackson[Jackson] as
supported library for the link:json.html[JSon] data format.
* Simplified using link:delayer.html[Delayer] especially in Spring DSL.
* Improved link:idempotent-consumer.html[Idempotent Consumer] to eagerly
detect duplicated messages for in progress exchanges.
* Added
link:how-do-i-set-the-max-chars-when-debug-logging-messages-in-camel.html[Camel
property to set a max chars limit] for `DEBUG` logs Message bodies. To
avoid logging very big payloads. The default limit is 1000 chars.
* Configuration of http proxy is now possible with the
link:http.html[HTTP] component
* link:message-filter.html[Message Filter] EIP marks Exchanges as
filtered and is now skipped for aggregation in `AggregationStrategy` for
example used when doing link:splitter.html[Splitter] or
link:aggregator.html[Aggregator]
* link:defaulterrorhandler.html[DefaultErrorHandler] is now just as
powerful as link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] support
redelivery et. all.
* link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] will by default
*handle* exceptions.
* link:transactionerrorhandler.html[TransactionErrorHandler] is now just
as powerful as link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel]
support redelivery et. all.

[[Camel2.0-M2Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default error handler is no longer
link:dead-letter-channel.html[Dead Letter Channel] but
link:defaulterrorhandler.html[DefaultErrorHandler] without redelivery
support. There are no single solution that fits all solutions, so you
should tailor the error handling according to your needs.
