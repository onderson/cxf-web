[[SEDA-SEDAComponent]]
SEDA Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *`seda:`* component provides
asynchronous https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_event-driven_architecture[SEDA]
behavior, so that messages are exchanged on a BlockingQueue and
consumers are invoked in a separate thread from the
producer.http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/seda/[]

Note that queues are only visible within a _single_
link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext]. If you want to communicate across
*`CamelContext`* instances (for example, communicating between Web
applications), see the link:vm.html[VM] component.

This component does not implement any kind of persistence or recovery,
if the VM terminates while messages are yet to be processed. If you need
persistence, reliability or distributed SEDA, try using either
link:jms.html[JMS] or link:activemq.html[ActiveMQ].

Synchronous

The link:direct.html[Direct] component provides synchronous invocation
of any consumers when a producer sends a message exchange.

[[SEDA-URIformat]]
URI format
^^^^^^^^^^

seda:someName[?options]

Where *`someName`* can be any string that uniquely identifies the
endpoint within the current link:camelcontext.html[CamelContext].

You can append query options to the URI in the following format:
*`?option=value&option=value&...`*

[[SEDA-Options]]
Options
^^^^^^^

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Since |Default |Description
|`size` |  |  a|
The maximum capacity of the *seda* queue, i.e., the number of messages
it can hold.

The default value in *Camel 2.2* or older is *`1000`*.

From *Camel 2.3*: the size is unbounded by default.

 

*Note:* Care should be taken when using this option. The size is
determined by the value specified _when the first endpoint is created_.
Each endpoint must therefore specify the same size.

*From* *Camel 2.11*: a validation is taken place to ensure if using
mixed queue sizes for the same queue name, Camel would detect this and
fail creating the endpoint.

|`concurrentConsumers` |  |`1` |Number of concurrent threads processing
exchanges.

|`waitForTaskToComplete` |  |`IfReplyExpected` a|
Option to specify whether the caller should wait for the asynchronous
task to complete before continuing.

The following options are supported:

* *`Always`*
* *`Never`*
* *`IfReplyExpected`*

The first two values are self-explanatory.

The last value, *`IfReplyExpected`*, will only wait if the message is
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] based.

See link:async.html[Async] messaging for more details.

|`timeout` |  |`30000` a|
Timeout (in milliseconds) before a *seda* producer will stop waiting for
an asynchronous task to complete.

See *`waitForTaskToComplete`* and link:async.html[Async] for more
details.

From *Camel 2.2:* you can now disable timeout by using *`0`* or a
negative value.

|`multipleConsumers` |*2.2* |`false` |Specifies whether multiple
consumers are allowed. If enabled, you can use link:seda.html[SEDA] for
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern[Publish-Subscribe]
messaging. That is, you can send a message to the *seda* queue and have
each consumer receive a copy of the message. When enabled, this option
should be specified on every consumer endpoint.

|`limitConcurrentConsumers` |*2.3* |`true` a|
Whether to limit the number of *`concurrentConsumers`* to the maximum of
*`500`*.

By default, an exception will be thrown if a *seda* endpoint is
configured with a greater number. You can disable that check by turning
this option off.

|`blockWhenFull` |*2.9* |`false` |Whether a thread that sends messages
to a full *seda* queue will block until the queue's capacity is no
longer exhausted. By default, an exception will be thrown stating that
the queue is full. By enabling this option, the calling thread will
instead block and wait until the message can be accepted.

|`queueSize` |*2.9* |  a|
*Component only:* the maximum size (capacity of the number of messages
it can hold) of the *seda* queue.

This option is used when *`size`* is not specified.

|`pollTimeout` |*2.9.3* |`1000` |*Consumer only*: the timeout used when
polling. When a timeout occurs, the consumer can check whether it is
allowed to continue running. Setting a lower value allows the consumer
to react more quickly upon shutdown.

|`purgeWhenStopping` |*2.11.1* |`false` |Whether to purge the task queue
when stopping the consumer/route. This allows to stop faster, as any
pending messages on the queue is discarded.

|`queue` |*2.12.0* |`null` |Define the queue instance which will be used
by *seda* endpoint

|`queueFactory` |*2.12.0* |`null` |Define the *`QueueFactory`* which
could create the queue for the *seda* endpoint

|`failIfNoConsumers` |*2.12.0* |`false` a|
Whether the producer should fail by throwing an exception when sending
to a *seda* queue with no active consumers.

Only one of the options *`discardIfNoConsumers`* and
*`failIfNoConsumers`* can be enabled at the same time.

|`discardIfNoConsumers` |*2.16* |`false` a|
Whether the producer should discard the message (do not add the message
to the queue) when sending to a *seda* queue with no active consumers. 

Only one of the options *`discardIfNoConsumers`*
and *`failIfNoConsumers`* can be enabled at the same time.

|=======================================================================

[[SEDA-ChoosingBlockingQueueimplementation]]
Choosing BlockingQueue implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.12*

xml<bean id="arrayQueue" class="java.util.ArrayBlockingQueue">
<constructor-arg index="0" value="10"> <!-- size --> <constructor-arg
index="1" value="true"> <!-- fairness --> </bean> <!-- ... --> <from
uri="seda:array?queue=#arrayQueue"/>

By default, the *seda* component instantiates a *`LinkedBlockingQueue`*.
However, a different implementation can be chosen by specifying a
custom  *`BlockingQueue`* implementation. When a custom implementation
is configured the *`size`* option is ignored.

The list of available *`BlockingQueueFactory`* implementations includes:

* *`LinkedBlockingQueueFactory`*
* *`ArrayBlockingQueueFactory`*
* *`PriorityBlockingQueueFactory`* +
 +

xml<bean id="priorityQueueFactory"
class="org.apache.camel.component.seda.PriorityBlockingQueueFactory">
<property name="comparator"> <bean
class="org.apache.camel.demo.MyExchangeComparator"/> </property> </bean>
<!-- ...and later --> <from
uri="seda:priority?queueFactory=#priorityQueueFactory&size=100"/> <!--
... --> 

[[SEDA-UseofRequestReply]]
Use of Request Reply
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The link:seda.html[SEDA] component supports using
link:request-reply.html[Request Reply], where the caller will wait for
the link:async.html[Async] route to complete. For instance:

javafrom("mina:tcp://0.0.0.0:9876?textline=true&sync=true")
.to("seda:input"); from("seda:input") .to("bean:processInput")
.to("bean:createResponse");

In the route above, we have a TCP listener on port *`9876`* that accepts
incoming requests. The request is routed to the *`seda:input`* queue. As
it is a link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] message, we wait for the
response. When the consumer on the *`seda:input`* queue is complete, it
copies the response to the original message response.

until 2.2: Works only with 2 endpoints

Using link:request-reply.html[Request Reply] over link:seda.html[SEDA]
or link:vm.html[VM] only works with 2 endpoints. You *cannot* chain
endpoints by sending to *`A -> B -> C`* etc. Only between *`A -> B`*.
The reason is the implementation logic is fairly simple. To support 3+
endpoints makes the logic much more complex to handle ordering and
notification between the waiting threads properly.

This has been improved in *Camel 2.3*, which allows you to chain as many
endpoints as you like.

[[SEDA-Concurrentconsumers]]
Concurrent consumers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the SEDA endpoint uses a single consumer thread, but you can
configure it to use concurrent consumer threads. So, instead of thread
pools you can use:

javafrom("seda:stageName?concurrentConsumers=5") .process(...)

As for the difference between the two, note a _thread pool_ can
increase/shrink dynamically at runtime depending on load, whereas the
number of concurrent consumers is always fixed.

[[SEDA-Threadpools]]
Thread pools
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Be aware that adding a thread pool to a *seda* endpoint by doing
something like:

javafrom("seda:stageName") .thread(5) .process(...)

Can wind up with two *`BlockQueues`:* one from the *seda* endpoint, and
one from the workqueue of the thread pool, which may not be what you
want. Instead, you might wish to configure a link:direct.html[Direct]
endpoint with a thread pool, which can process messages both
synchronously and asynchronously. For example:

javafrom("direct:stageName") .thread(5) .process(...)

You can also directly configure number of threads that process messages
on a *seda* endpoint using the *`concurrentConsumers`* option.

[[SEDA-Sample]]
Sample
^^^^^^

In the route below we use the SEDA queue to send the request to this
asynchronous queue to be able to send a fire-and-forget message for
further processing in another thread, and return a constant reply in
this thread to the original
caller.INLINE\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/seda/SedaAsyncRouteTest.java}Here
we send a Hello World message and expects the reply to be
OK.INLINE\{snippet:id=e2|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/camel-core/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/seda/SedaAsyncRouteTest.java}The *`Hello World`*
message will be consumed from the *seda* queue from another thread for
further processing. Since this is from a unit test, it will be sent to a
*`mock`* endpoint where we can do assertions in the unit test.

[[SEDA-UsingmultipleConsumers]]
Using `multipleConsumers`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Available as of Camel 2.2*

In this example we have defined two consumers and registered them as
spring
beans.INLINE\{snippet:id=e1|lang=xml|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/resources/org/apache/camel/spring/example/fooEventRoute.xml}Since
we have specified *`multipleConsumers=true`* on the *seda* *`foo`*
endpoint we can have those two consumers receive their own copy of the
message as a kind of pub-sub style messaging.

As the beans are part of an unit test they simply send the message to
a *`mock`* endpoint. Note the use of *`@Consume`* to consume from the
*seda*
queue.INLINE\{snippet:id=e1|lang=java|url=camel/trunk/components/camel-spring/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/spring/example/FooEventConsumer.java}

[[SEDA-ExtractingQueueInformation.]]
Extracting Queue Information.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If needed, information such as queue size, etc. can be obtained without
using JMX in this fashion:

javaSedaEndpoint seda = context.getEndpoint("seda:xxxx"); int size =
seda.getExchanges().size();
