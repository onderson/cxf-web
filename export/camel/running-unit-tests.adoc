Testing
~~~~~~~

Before you can run the tests you need to follow the steps for
link:building.html[Building].

By default when you run the *install* goal in maven the unit tests will
all be run.

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn clean install
----

If you want to run the integration tests as well you can use the
integration test profile...

[source,brush:,java;,gutter:,false;,theme:,Default]
----
mvn clean install -P integration
----
