[[Camel2.10.0Release-NewandNoteworthy]]
New and Noteworthy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the 2.10.0 release with approximately 483 issues resolved -
including new features, improvements, and bug fixes, such as:

* Added support for Java 1.7
* Added consumer to link:jcr.html[JCR] component
* Internal code cleanup to reduce warnings reported by Eclipse
* Moved link:spring-testing.html[Spring Testing] from `camel-test` to
`camel-test-spring` component.
* Camel link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Property Placeholders] are
now supported in embedded link:expression.html[Expression]s within Camel
routes.
* Added missing options in the XML DSL for the link:xpath.html[XPath]
language to control and set which XPath Engine to use, etc.
* Added option `logNamespaces` to the link:xpath.html[XPath] language to
have `INFO` logging of detected namespaces from message. This can be
used to troubleshoot issues where an link:xpath.html[XPath] expression
doesn't work as expected (as it's often a namespace conflict).
* Added `replyToCacheLevelName` option to the link:jms.html[JMS]
component, allowing configuration of cache levels for persistent reply
consumers when doing request/reply over JMS. Some message brokers do not
work well with caching, so users may need to set this option to
`CACHE_NONE`.
* Added `antInclude` and `antExclude` options to link:file2.html[File]
and link:ftp2.html[FTP] components to make it easier to specify
include/exclude filters using ANT syntax.
* The link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel archetypes] for Java and
Scala no longer generate projects with Spring dependencies.
* Improved `JdbcMessageIdRepository` in the link:sql-component.html[SQL]
to use custom SQL statements/queries.
* Added option to link:properties.html[Properties] to allow silently
ignoring property locations not found, such as a .properties file.
* Added `managementNamePattern` attribute to `<camelContext>` to make it
very easy to customize and control the JMX naming of the Camel
application. See details at link:camel-jmx.html[Camel JMX]. For example,
in OSGi environments you can explicitly configure a
`managementNamePattern` in case you do not want the bundleId as part of
MBean names.
* Added streaming update support to link:solr.html[Solr] as well as
support for SolrInputDocuments
* Added SolrJ DirectXMLRequest support to link:solr.html[Solr] to
support XML based index updates
* Improved Camel link:mail.html[Mail] to support the `replyTo` option
* Added `traceEnabled` option to link:jetty.html[Jetty] component so you
have control over whether to allow HTTP TRACE calls against your Jetty
endpoints.
* Polished the link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel Maven Archetypes]
to let the projects be prepared for link:testing.html[Testing], and
fixed any WARNs from Maven.
* Added `dumpRouteStatsAsXml` methods to link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] to
make it easier to get the total performance stats as XML, and in one JMX
call.
* link:graceful-shutdown.html[Graceful Shutdown] is now more aggressive
if timeout occurred during shutdown, rejecting continued processing of
messages or redeliveries.
* Add `ShutdownPrepared` SPI to allow custom Services (also EIPs) in
routes to do custom code in preparation for shutdown.
* The `camel-archetype-java` link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel
Maven Archetypes] is now a pure Java DSL based project (no longer
Spring)
* link:jms.html[JMS] consumer is less verbose when logging uncaught
exceptions thrown while processing a message. Added
`errorHandlerLoggingLevel`, and `errorHandlerLogStackTrace` options to
tweak the logging verbosity.
* Added `messageId` as an link:mdc-logging.html[MDC logging] key.
* Improved Camel's Transaction link:error-handler.html[Error Handler]
logging to better pinpoint and correlate redelivered messages (from,
e.g., a JMS broker), making the logs much easier to read.
* Added a timeout option to link:spring-web-services.html[Spring Web
Services] for specifying the read timeout while invoking a webservice.
* Optimized link:type-converter.html[Type Converter] registry for
possible concurrency contention when looking up a type converter.
* Improved link:simple.html[Simple] language to work better with
floating point numbers in link:predicate.html[Predicate]s
* Camel is now less verbose when starting and stopping, with less being
logged at `INFO` level.
* Add support for keyed data queues to link:jt400.html[JT400] component.
* link:idempotent-consumer.html[Idempotent Consumer] is now enlisted in
JMX, which allows monitoring the duplicate message count as well as the
operation to reset it.
* Thread pools registered in link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] are now
unregistered when Camel shuts them down. Note that all MBeans will be
unregistered from JMX when Camel shuts itself down. This improvement is
to unregister thread pools more eagerly, such as when routes are removed
at runtime.
* Camel will now also copy the message headers for a `JmsMessage` if you
leverage `useOriginalMessage` in an `onException` definition.
* Added `mockEndpointsAndSkip` to link:advicewith.html[AdviceWith] and
the link:testing.html[Test Kit]
* The link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] components now
support filtering directories. The `isDirectory` method on the
`GenericFile` class can be used to skip unwanted directories,
accelerating file consumption.
* link:smpp.html[SMPP] connections can now be tunneled through an HTTP
proxy by configuring HTTP proxy settings.
* Camel now also checks, when starting a route dynamically, whether
there would be any violations on multiple consumers from the same
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint]. Previously this check only occurred during
Camel startup - now it always happens.
* Stopping a `ConsumerTemplate` or a `ProducerTemplate` will now stop
and shutdown its cache to cleanup any resources which otherwise may not
have been reclaimed until shutdown.
* http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/impl/ScheduledPollConsumer.html[ScheduledPollConsumer]
will now shutdown thread pools more eagerly, such as when stopping a
`ConsumerTemplate`.
* Added option `asyncStartListener` to link:jms.html[JMS] to allow
starting JMS consumers (e.g. routes) asynchronously. This can be used to
avoid blocking in case the JMS consumer takes long time to establish a
connection to the JMS broker.
* link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] now supports
link:error-handling-in-camel.html[Error Handling] when sending a tapped
message to an link:endpoint.html[Endpoint].
* Added the autogenColumns, configRef and strategyRef options to the
link:csv.html[CSV] dataformat in XML DSL whereas the new skipFirstLine
option is provided in Java API as well.
* link:validation.html[Validator] component will now fail with a better
error message if resource schema refers to element which cannot be
resolved.
* Added support for retrieving generated keys from link:jdbc.html[JDBC]
component.
* Added support for Spring 3.1.x.
* Added `retainFirst`, and `retainLast` options to link:mock.html[Mock]
component.
* Improved link:simple.html[Simple] language to allow referring to
headers using bracket notation.
* Added support for the scp: protocol via link:jsch.html[Jsch].
* Added support to exclude certain fields when marshalling POJO's to
link:json.html[JSON]. Available with both the Jackson and GSON library.
* Allow to configure frequency of timeout checker when doing
request/reply over link:jms.html[JMS]
* Improved the Java DSL to make it easier to use predicates from the
build-in DSL, that has commonly used predicates and expressions.
* link:aggregator2.html[Aggregate] EIP now supports
`TimeoutAwareAggregationStrategy` aggregation strategies.
* The default `Injector` now performs bean post processing to inject
@Produce, @Consume, @EndpointInject fields etc.
* The link:camel-run-maven-goal.html[camel-run] maven plugin now
supports running link:using-osgi-blueprint-with-camel.html[OSGi
Blueprint applications].
* Added utilization statistics to the type converter registry (which can
be accessed from link:camel-jmx.html[JMX]), and are logged as Camel is
shutting down.
* Improved link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] to work better with servers such as
WebSphere which alters MBean names when enlisting mbeans into the server
(Camel now have an internal mapping table).
* All link:eip.html[EIP]s out of the box from Camel now provides
link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] utilization statistics.
* The link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] consumers will now
let `org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler` deal with exceptions
occurred during acquiring real lock as well. See link:file2.html[File]
page for example of using a custom `ExceptionHandler`.
* Reduce the logging level from ERROR to WARN on the default
`LoggingExceptionHandler`.
* Added option `consumer.bridgeErrorHandler` to allow consumers such as
link:file2.html[File] and link:ftp2.html[FTP] to use the routing engine
link:error-handler.html[Error Handler] to deal with exceptions occurring
in the consumer (outside the routing engine), for example if having
trouble picking up a file from a shared network drive etc. See more
details at link:file2.html[File] page. This option applies to all
consumers which extends the `DefaultConsumer` from `camel-core`.
* Added `eagerMaxMessagesPerPoll` option to link:file2.html[File], and
link:ftp2.html[FTP] endpoints to allow to do a full sorting of the files
and also limit the pool at the same time
* The link:xslt.html[XSLT], link:velocity.html[Velocity],
link:freemarker.html[FreeMarker], and
link:stringtemplate.html[StringTemplate] components using http resource
for the template now supports query parameters
* You can specify the class type with link:bindy.html[Bindy] to make it
stand out what type is being used, as well the `unmarshal` operation
returns a list of the pojos (and the pojo directly if only 1). Which
makes it easier to use/work with.
* Added `group` option to link:tokenizer.html[Tokenizer] to make it
easier with the link:splitter.html[Splitter] to split by combining N
number of parts together, eg splitting files in chunks by N lines
combined.
* Camel is now compatible to the upcoming Karaf 3 release
* Added `ExchangeSendingEvent` to `EventNotifier` to emit an event
*before* sending an link:exchange.html[Exchange] to an
link:endpoint.html[Endpoint]. Then we have events for both before and
after.
* Relaxed syntax check in link:simple.html[Simple] language to only scan
for functions if a start token was explicit configured. This allows to
easier do json like expressions.
* Added support for escaping values in link:simple.html[Simple] language
using the \ character.
* Added new link:camel-maven-archetypes.html[Camel Maven Archetypes] for
creating new link:component.html[Component] using Scala.
* Added `trim` option to link:languages.html[Languages] in the XML DSL,
to control trimming the expression values, to remove the whitespace
noise from XML tags.
* Improved the link:file2.html[File] consumer to support competing
consumers on a shared drive to not pickup files from other consumers, as
marker file is always used, for `readLock` strategies such as changed,
rename and fileLock. For example if you have a clustered environment and
have multiple Camel applications pickup files from a shared drive with
`readLock=changed`.
* The link:file2.html[File] consumer with `readLock=changed` will now
consider zero length file as in progress files.
* Made it easier to link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[bridge Spring
and Camel property placeholders], by configuring only once, using a new
`BridgePropertyPlaceholderConfigurer` bean type.
* Improved the link:smpp.html[SMPP] component to refer to a
`org.jsmpp.session.SessionStateListener` to receive callbacks when the
session state changed.
* Added connection pooling to link:jt400.html[JT400] component
* link:restlet.html[Restlet] component can be configured with Restlet
Server parameters, for example to configure thread pool sizes.
* CamelContext MBean in link:camel-jmx.html[JMX] now shows aggregated
performance stats for all the routes
* Made it easy to override properties when link:testing.html[Testing]
with Camel when link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Using
PropertyPlaceholder]. For example unit testing with OSGi Blueprint using
config admin service to provide properties, is now easy as you can
provide the properties from directly within the unit test source code
itself.
* Improved link:netty.html[Netty] to support both shareable and
non-shareable encoders and decoders.
* Improved link:netty.html[Netty] to support proxy use cases (eg
`from(netty).to(netty)`)
* Added `CompletionAwareAggregationStrategy` to
link:aggregator2.html[Aggregator] EIP as callback when the aggregated
exchange is completed.
* Scheduled link:polling-consumer.html[Polling Consumer] and poll based
link:component.html[Component]s such as link:file2.html[File], and
link:ftp2.html[FTP] can now use a custom/shared thread pool for its
consumer(s). For example having many file routes, can now share a thread
pool, and reduce number of overall threads in the JVM.
* Optimized link:bean.html[Bean] expressions to cache bean
introspections so subsequent evaluations is faster.

[[Camel2.10.0Release-Fixedissues]]

attempts.
* Fixed issue with a failed type conversion using link:jaxb.html[JAXB]
may cause subsequent attempts to be regarded as failed as well

[[Camel2.10.0Release-APIchanges/breaking]]
API changes/breaking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added `shutdownForced` and `forceShutdown` methods to
`org.apache.camel.spi.ShutdownStrategy`
* Add boolean parameter to `prepareShutdown` on `ShutdownAware`
* The `errorHandler` method in `RouteBuilder` now returns `void`, as
it's only used for configuring context-scoped error handlers.
* Removed the `SimpleLanguage` constructor that takes custom start and
end tokens. Instead use the change methods to set custom tokens.
* Added `onThreadPoolRemove` and `onErrorHandlerRemove` methods to
`LifecycleStrategy`
* Removed `retryWhile(Expression)` on `OnExceptionDefinition`; use
`retryWhile(Predicate)`.
* Removed options `corePoolSize` and `maxPoolSize` on
link:netty.html[Netty] endpoint, as we rely on Netty default
implementation.
* The `resourceClasses` option on link:cxfrs.html[CXFRS] no longer
supports the semicolon
(image:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/s/en_GB/5997/6f42626d00e36f53fe51440403446ca61552e2a2.1/_/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png[(wink)]
for separating class names. Now only the comma (,) is supported (which
is the standard in Camel)
* Added `tryConvertTo` methods to `TypeConverter`, which works as the
regular `convertTo` methods, by ignoring any exceptions during
conversion.
* The `convertTo` methods on `TypeConverter` now throws
`TypeConversionException` if an exception occurred during type
conversion.
* The `getBody(type)`, and `getHeader(name, type` methods on `Message`
now throws `TypeConversionException` if an exception occurred during
type conversion.
* The link:simple.html[Simple] language no longer trim the expression in
Java DSL. Instead we introduced a `trim` option in the XML DSL to remove
the white space noise from XML tags.
* Added `containsSynchronization` to `UnitOfWork` and `Exchange` to
check if a given on completion has already been added to the given
exchange.

[[Camel2.10.0Release-Internal/NonAPIrefactoringsthatmayaffectusers]]
Internal/Non API refactorings that may affect users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Removed method `setManagementName` from `CamelContext` as it should
not be used by Camel end users
* Added method `isTransactedRedelivered` to link:exchange.html[Exchange]
* Added method `isDirectory` to `GenericFile`
* API changed in the `ClientPipelineFactory` and `ServerPipelineFactory`
abstract classes in link:netty.html[Netty]
* Added `getStatistics` method to `TypeConverterRegistry`, and the
registry now extends `Service` as well.
* The `convertBodyTo` with a charset configured, will not propagate the
charset as an Exchange property (`Exchange.CHARSET_NAME`), which
otherwise may lead to payload being double converted.
* Added `abort` method to `GenericFileProcessStrategy`.
* `camel-mail` now excludes dependency on javax activation JAR as thats
embedded in the JVM from JRE6 onwards.
* URI normalization will now better detect
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url_encode[pre existing % decimal encoded
values].

[[Camel2.10.0Release-KnownIssues]]
Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The link:tracer.html[Tracer] may not output all details for some
situations, such as when using `onCompletion` or `intercept`, etc.
* The project cannot fully build the site using Maven (e.g. running
`"mvn site"`). There is no plan to fix this, as the project does not use
maven site.
* JBoss 7 may log a WARNing when running Camel as a WAR file.
* camel-spring-test bundle has the classes from camel-test, if you are
using camel-spring-test in OSGi platform, please don't install the
camel-test at the same time.
* link:cxf-example-osgi.html[CXF Example OSGi] doesn't work without
enabling dynamic imports for this bundle.

[[Camel2.10.0Release-Importantchangestoconsiderwhenupgrading]]
Important changes to consider when upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Moved link:spring-testing.html[Spring Testing] from `camel-test` to
`camel-test-spring` component.
* Combination of `skipSendToEndpoint=true` and `when` predicate now
triggers conditional skipping (you may have been relying on
unconditional skipping up until now)
* The thread name pattern has changed tokens to avoid clashing with
link:using-propertyplaceholder.html[Using PropertyPlaceholder] (see
link:threading-model.html[Threading Model] for more details).
* link:content-enricher.html[Poll Enrich] will now block if no messages
are available and no explicit timeout has been configured.
* The option `lazyLoadTypeConverter=true` has been deprecated, and will
be removed in a future release. The best practice is to load type
converters while bootstrapping Camel.
* The link:testing.html[Camel Test kit] no longer lazily loads type
converters.
* Keys for link:mdc-logging.html[MDC logging] have been prefixed with
`"camel."`.
* link:wire-tap.html[Wire Tap] can no longer change destination from
link:camel-jmx.html[JMX]
* Camel now fail faster during type conversion, by throwing
`TypeConversionException` to the caller, from APIs such as
`TypeConverter` and `Message`. For example `getBody(type)` on the
`Message` API.
* Camel no longer supports using `java.beans.PropertyEditor` for type
conversion. These are slow, neither thread safe, and using 3rd party
JARs on the classpath may cause side effect as if they install
`java.beans.PropertyEditor`.
* Use the `charset` option on the link:file2.html[File] component to
explicit specify encoding for reading and writing files.
* Maven 3.0.2 or better is required to build the
link:source.html[Source]

[[Camel2.10.0Release-Notice]]
Notice
~~~~~~

* If you want to deploy Apache Camel 2.10.0 into Apache Karaf, we highly
recommend to use the 'jre.properties.cxf' configuration, which is part
of Apache Karaf 2.2.5 onwards. For example `camel-cxf`, and
`camel-spring-ws` requires this to be installable; as well other
features may as well.
* Support for JUnit 3.x in the Camel link:testing.html[Test]s components
is being discontinued and expected to be removed from Camel 2.11
onwards.
